## Slide 1: Data 88E: Economic Models

- Lecture 1: Introduction and Overview

## Slide 2: A fun aside - the logo derived from stonks meme

## Slide 3: TL;DR of the course

- Examine economics concepts through real-world data and data science methods.
- Motivate economics topics through modeling
- Practice Python skills while learning economics concepts.
- 9th time being offered!

## Slide 4: Jupyter as inspiration

- Almost everything you’ll do will be in Jupyter, using Python.
- Textbook
- The textbook is compiled and structured via Jupyter Books, with each page written using Jupyter Notebooks
- Interactivity
- Jupyter Notebooks facilitates interactive computing, encouraging learning by doing and tinkering. This applies to the textbook too!
- Data Centric
- Jupyter Notebooks were built to conduct data analysis.
- The course is an open source project  - you too can collaborate!

## Slide 5: Why should I take this course?

- Student Instructors: We built this course to be a class that we wish we could’ve taken when we were Freshmen or Sophomores. Essentially, it’s everything related to data science & economics that we wish we would’ve known a couple years ago.
- This course will:
- Prepare students for upper division economics courses and research.
- Apply data science, computation, and visualization techniques to the field of economics based on real world data.
- Survey economics subdomains including financial economics, development economics, macroeconomic policy, econometrics, and more.
- Motivate modeling, the use of tools and techniques, explore the intersection of economics and data science.

## Slide 6: Prerequisites

- Data 8, or some basic programming/data science equivalent (e.g. STAT 20 w/ R).
- It will be harder to follow on, and succeed, if you do not have Data 8.
- Specifically there is a package  datascience
- with Table commands
- Economics coursework is not necessary, but will be helpful.
- Python experience will be fundamental
- If you are a Concurrent Enrollment student - you may have to decide for yourself!
- Look at last year’s class assignments
- Look at Data 8 assignments

## Slide 7: What is a connector course?

- The design of the course is for 1st/2nd year students - who are currently or recently taken Data 8  - https://www.data8.org/
- Linked to topics and pace of Data 8
- Connectors give a domain specific application of Data 8 toolset
- If you haven’t taken Data 8 - the Data 8 textbook is also useful
  - https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html
- There is a lot behind these materials that we weren’t able to fit into the course.
- Find a study group - come to office hours
- Ask questions on Ed for other students to answer?

## Slide 8: Will I be challenged?

- If you are a junior/senior with a programming background or have taken advanced upper division Econ classes, this course will be pretty easy. As a result, we expect you to:
- Go above and beyond in the labs, dig into the programming and routines beyond just clicking through the notebooks.
- Read the papers behind the materials in the class.
- Think about the limitations in our presented methods.
- Use these labs as a starting point and try some programming on your own.
- There is a lot behind these materials that we weren’t able to fit into the course.
- Help other students out - You can learn by teaching!
- We get scores from Ed discussions on who answers other’s questions

## Slide 9: You better help other students

- You better help other students

## Slide 10: A Caveat

- This class a work in progress - while we’ve offered it for several semesters now, we’re still looking to continue improving on the content!
- Basically it’s complicated, lots of complicated labs
- You will help to participate, give feedback, and improve the course!
- Hybrid Instruction in uncertain times - we have no idea how the semester will play out:  Omicron, COVID, Power Shutoff, People’s Park

## Slide 11: Fall Semester Hex - back in my day

## Slide 12: Data Paradise

- You will be in data paradise this semester. We will largely clean the data for you.
- After this class, expect to experience Paradise Lost.
- “[Data scientist] respondents reported they spent most of their time cleaning data (60 percent), and [noted the] task to be the least enjoyable part of their job (57 percent).”
- We would’ve liked to teach data cleaning as well in this course, but there simply wasn’t enough time :(

## Slide 13: Expectations for in person instruction

- This class is planned being taught in person. In case you cannot make it to class due to an emergency, please make a private Ed post explaining why by 11:59 pm on the Tuesday before lecture. If your excuse is legitimate, we will give an alternative method for you to make up the lecture.
- DO NOT COME if you are sick

## Slide 14: Student Instruction!

- This class is created by students who were interested in these topics.
- Students teach some of the classes! Or part of the classes!
- Bennett - Macro
- Peter - Environmental
- Guest Speakers
- And the class evolves and changes every semester:
- Bear with us if it’s bumpy
