## Slide 1: Data 88E: Economic Models

- Lecture 2: Demand & Elasticity

## Slide 2: Logistics

- Lab 1 and Project 1: You can access your first lab and project from the website. The first lab is due before next lecture at midnight on Sep 10th and the first project is due at midnight on Sep 17th. Please begin working on them soon!
- Remember, if you cannot finish the assignments on time, you can still submit them for partial credit.

## Slide 3: Lab and Project

- The Gradescope assignments for both the lab and project are already set up. Later tonight, there will be a Ed post with instructions on how to submit the assignments. Please follow the instructions in the post carefully. Until then, you can work on the lab and project on your own - remember to save the files while you are working on them so you don’t lose any progress!
- Pro Tip from Staff: Use the Textbook and attend Office Hours! Helped me a lot.
- Please check that you are on Ed and Gradescope over the next couple of days- email if you have problems

## Slide 4: Roadmap

## Slide 5: Definition

- Relationship between price of a good or service and the quantity demanded for that good or service at each price
- Let’s start with an example from a textbook
- An individual person’s demand
- Kms driven per semester

## Slide 6: Demand Slopes Down - Law of Demand

- Slopes down for 3 reasons:
- Decreasing Marginal Benefit   - Diminishing Marginal Utility
  - You don’t need that much of any one good!
- Substitution Effect
  - You can get utility from other goods
- Income Effect
  - A cheaper price leaves more money in your pocket to buy more

## Slide 7: Demand Slopes Down - Demand Schedule

- Decreasing Marginal Benefit
- Tanks of gas per semester
- First tank is worth a lot… last tank worth less

## Slide 8: Demand Slopes Down

- Behind a smooth curve is a chunky staircase

USD/gal: $0.79 USD = 1 CAD → $10.44/gal
Current CAD/L 1.305

## Slide 9: Demand Slopes Down

## Slide 10: 2) Income Effect

- If price goes down, you have more money left to spend!
- What do Canadians call their money?

## Slide 11: 3) Substitution Effect

- If price of a good goes up, similar goods become relatively cheaper and more attractive

## Slide 12: Price of Complements

- Tolls?
- Open Freeways?

## Slide 13: Price of Substitutes

- Lime? Bart? Uber?

## Slide 14: Micromobility Demand

- In 2019, people in the United States took 136 million trips on shared bikes, e-bikes, and scooters, 60% more than 2018.
- National Association of City Transportation Officials
- Why?

## Slide 15: Shifts in Demand Curve

- Exogenous events (outside of the market) can affect the demand curve
- Buyer's income
- Consumer preferences
- Expectation of future price/supply/demand
- Changes in the price of related goods

## Slide 16: US Gasoline Consumption has flattened

- https://wolfstreet.com/2024/03/07/gasoline-demand-has-a-long-term-structural-problem-plunging-per-capita-consumption/

## Slide 17: Per Capita Gasoline Sales are going down

## Slide 18: Elasticity along a curve - From Textbook

## Slide 19: Elasticity

- Inelastic - price changes and quantity does not
- Medical necessity
- Steeper Curve
- Elastic - price changes and quantity moves more
- Lots of Substitutes
- Flatter Curve

## Slide 20: Types of Elasticity

- Price Elasticity of Demand (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in own Price)
- PED >1 - elastic
- demand is responsive to price - for a given change in P -> bigger change in Q
- PED<1 - inelastic
- demand is NOT responsive to price - for a given change in P -> smaller change in Q
- Income Elasticity of Demand
- (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income)
- Cross Price Elasticity of Demand
- (% Change in Quantity Demanded of Good A) / (% Change in Price of Good B)
- XED > 0 - Substitute
- Increase in price for Good B -> Increase in Demand for Good A
- XED < 0 - Complement
- Increase in price for Good B -> Decrease in Demand for Good A

## Slide 21: A debate - beef vs chicken - Preferences or Prices?

- Pounds Consumed per person per year

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

## Slide 25: A debate - beef vs chicken - Preferences or Prices?

## Slide 26: Price of Chicken and Beef during Covid-19

- How do you think chicken and beef prices fluctuated?
- Chicken - Consumers perceive link between virus and poultry
  - In India, chicken prices have decreased by 70%
  - “People were avoiding consumption of meat, fish, chicken, and egg” -
- Economic Times of India
- Beef - Supply change interruption because meat packing factories are a covid hotspot
  - The retail price for beef in April was $6.22 per pound — 26 cents higher per pound than the month before (BLS)
  - At the same time, at the end of April, the average price for a steer was below $100 per hundred pounds; the five-year average for that same week was about $135 per hundred pounds
  - Unexpected price fluctuations → USDA investigation
- Politico
