## Slide 32: End of Facebook ->  A/B testing -> Experimental Design

- How do we test different populations?
- Test within a population
- What is the population
- If we do randomization right we can make generalizations about the entire population
- How do we split up populations into comparable subsets
- Internet  - easy
- Surveys / Drug Trials  - harder
- Need a map of the domain to do randomization from
- What list ,  how to check the balance

## Slide 33: Data 8 Chapter 2

- John Snow and the Broad Street Pump
- 1854

## Slide 34: Observational Studies ~ Confounding Variables

- Inferential Thinking
- “ what if some people worked in a factory and some did not”
- Or ….  Does Coffee cause lung cancer?
- -- but … smoking
- Observational Studies
- You can measure correlation
- But you can’t measure causation unless you can control for all confounding variables
- Experimental Design ( Project 3)
- Eighty-four pairs of undergraduate volunteers between the ages of 18 and 26 from North Dakota State University participated for course credit and were randomly assigned to either an asymmetrical or symmetrical camera condition.

## Slide 35: A/B Testing in Project  3

## Slide 36: Clinical Trials  - Randomization of population

- Phase 1 - ( 20-50 people)
- Is the Treatments Safe?
- Measure and Observe Side Effects
- Phase 2 - ( 50-100 people)
- Does the treatment works
- Recruit people with the disease
- Phase 3 - ( 1000s of people)
- Randomized population
- Placebo given to Control population
- Double Blinded - participant and researcher

## Slide 37: Covid 19 Clinical Trials - 2021

## Slide 41: Long term solution is clean water and sanitation

- https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera

## Slide 42: Effectiveness of Government Programs - Impact Evaluation

- What is the most effective way to :
- Save lives  (e.g for children under 5)
- Change behavior  ( sanitation & hygiene)
- Improve people’s welfare
- For governments and policymakers - National or Local Governments
- For implementers  - Local or International NGOS
- For International Donors  ( Gates Foundation)

## Slide 43: Is it the domain of Economics?

- Public Health – address health issues
- Epidemiology – measure sickness
- Microbiology – measure contamination
- Behavioral Science – nudges
- Environmental Engineering – who often takes on these issues
- Economics - costs of different approaches
  - Technology adoption
  - Behavior changes around technology
- Objective outcome measures

## Slide 44: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)  in Economics

- Also called Impact Evaluation
- Effectiveness of Aid – interest to measure impacts of
- international projects, health interventions, schooling, welfare
- Impact of a program, device, innovation, system, behavior change, education
- Causality cannot be determined in observational studies
- Compare to a control group - a counterfactual - a comparison group
- Endogeneity of economic choices - Remove Selection Bias!
- In an observational study you cannot separate correlation from causality – because of factors involving  selection into the treatment. Those who sign up are different from those who do not

## Slide 45: 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics

- Jpal - Poverty Action Lab
- MIT and Harvard Faculty
- Leaders in RCT movement

- Intestinal parasites that could be easily treated
  - Work with NGO that was going to pilot mass de-worming
  - Randomize which schools would get the interventions
- Water borne diarrheal diseases
  - Work with NGO to improve local water sources
  - Randomize communities getting improved springs
  - Also have water related hygiene behaviors

## Slide 48: Deworming RCT

- Deworming RCT
- Simple single pill for worm ( helminths)
- Mass Deworming - giving pill to entire sectors of population, using existing infrastructure like schools

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Line up the students]
Give them a pill and 

What about handwashing, and open defacation, and shoes, and concrete floors?

</details>

## Slide 49: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012.3.22-Deworming.pdf

- https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012.3.22-Deworming.pdf
- Data for
- Students with treatment in treatment school
- Students without treatment in treatment school
- Students in other schools

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Outcome varialbe – 14.6 more days of school

Untreated also affected – this is usually a problem
Usually you are trying to not have spillovers if you are measuring treatment – control
But they did some more advanced techniques to establish a counterfactual for spillovers as well.
Contaminated the control!  But it was an awesome outcome so measure and show it

## Slide 72: Peer Effects in Dispensers

- You do it because others are doing it
- Visibly see others doing it
- Discuss it , get knowledge about it, becomes “normal”

## Slide 73: Salience  - noticeable, important, prominent

- Make sure that a problem , and solution are visible
  - Diarrhea – not so visible
  - Microbes in drinking water – not visible
- Human behaviors that reduce risks – not always visible
- Remember to Use it – reinforcement of a daily behavior
- See it while doing the water collecting moment
- Visible / standing out because of the placement

- Big Picture – how does a survey flow and look all together
  - Experimental Design
  - Survey Design
- Details – how do different modules work specifically
- Critically – does this make sense, will the answers be useful?  What have the survey authors done to help to make answers useful?
- I want you to see a big messy dataset or 2 or 3 that are part of a real research project, that leads to a graph at the end
  - (that is part of someone winning a Nobel Prize?)

## Slide 80: Start with Springs Sample and Map

- Google Maps of Western Kenya
- Look at how Springs as Treatment Arms are scattered
- Think about spatial randomization
- Tips
- If maps not displaying reload the browser page
- Click to Satellite within map window

## Slide 81: (untitled)

- LINK to SURVEY

## Slide 82: Closed/Limited Answers

- Want to make a specific set of answers
  - Not Open Ended
  - Not Text
- Simple codes are in survey - WGP  Baseline
  - 1=yes 2=no
  - 88= don’t know
- Code sheet – with numbers for fixed answers for most common responses – when there are many
- Want answers to be in a certain range, or of a certain type

## Slide 83: (untitled)

## Slide 84: Treatment Arms

- This variable is added to dataset afterwards
- Arm 1 - Control
- Arm 2 - Household Script
- Arm 3 - Community Script
- Arm 4 - HH + Community Script
- Arm 5 - Flat-Fee Promoter + Coupons
- Arm 6 - Incentivized Promoter + Coupons
- Arm 7 - Incentivized Promoter + Dispenser at Spring

## Slide 85: Elements of Survey Design

- Start with  map of region, list of houses
- Number and randomize springs
- Number and randomize houses around each spring
- Important for later checks
  - Who is doing survey
  - Who is doing data entry
  - What if there is variability in the reliability of the answers?

## Slide 86: Missing Data and skip patterns

- There is missing data - and what to do about it!!!
- NAN - pandas has routines for NAN
- There are skip patterns in surveys
- e.g. Depending on the Answer to Question 1
- If answer yes go to question 1b, 1c, 1d
- If answer no go to question 2
