## Slide 18: Central Tenets: Environmental Amenities

- What are environmental amenities?
- Clean air, water, and stable temperatures
- Healthy soil, forests, and oceans
- Also parks, rivers, mountains, beaches!
- What do you notice about these?
- Non-rivalrous (ish): use does not reduce the amount available for others.
- Non-excludable (ish): use does not exclude a certain person or group of persons from consumption.
- What are these also known as?
  - Public goods!
- Central to Environmental Economics models:
- Usage of these go unaccounted for in the current market models.

## Slide 19: Trends: The Environmental Kuznets Curve Theory

- Theory:
- Economic development and environmental degradation have a downward-facing U-shape relationship.
- For example:
- Pollution, water quality, deforestation
- In our demo, we will be checking the path over different stages of
- economic development in 15 nations!

## Slide 20: Class question

- What shape do you think the relationship between economic development and environmental degradation have? Here are some ideas:

## Slide 28: Trends: DATA88’s Rösling World Emissions Plot

- Question: What happens as we add the time dimension?
- Data Source: Gapminder Foundation

## Slide 29: Conclusion Part I

- We now have an overview of historical and current emissions across the world.
- We have also looked into potential trends in growth and emissions.
- We have a large share of the emissions coming from wealthier countries over a long period of time.
- Our question now is: How do we abate these emissions, asap and in the most cost-effective way?

## Slide 30: Part II:

	Introducing the Marginal Cost of Abatement Curve

- Part II:
- Introducing the Marginal Cost of Abatement Curve

## Slide 31: MAC: Theory

- How do we build one? How do we interpret one? What are the ‘secrets’ of the curve?
- Abatement Cost ($/ton CO2)
- Abatement Potential (tons CO2)

## Slide 32: Class question

- How would a Marginal Abatement Curve for an individual firm look like?

## Slide 33: MAC: From the Firm’s Perspective

- Suppose a firm has 5 options to change their production to produce less GHG
- Each option has a different abatement cost and abatement potential, here’s how it would look like:

## Slide 35: MAC: From the Global Policymaker’s Perspective

## Slide 36: MAC: Key Areas of Abatement

- Source: A cost curve for greenhouse gas reduction | McKinsey (2007)

## Slide 37: Class question

- How do you think the MAC is affected by oil prices? What would change, and how?

## Slide 38: MAC: Affected by High Energy Prices

- Source: A cost curve for greenhouse gas reduction | McKinsey (2007)

## Slide 39: MAC: Dynamic vs. Static Costs Assessment

- The McKinsey MAC considers only static costs!
- Static Costs:
- The fixed costs of a new intervention, unchanged over a lifetime of an investment.
- Dynamic Costs:
- Cost considering potential cost-reduction from increased efficiency, learning-by-doing, and other positive spillovers.

## Slide 41: MAC: Capital Intensity

- Question: How capital intensive are different technologies?   Role for Government Subsidies?
- Source: A cost curve for greenhouse gas reduction | McKinsey (2007)
- Green New Deal - Build Back Better?

## Slide 42: MAC: DATA88’s MAC for Methane

- Data Source: Methane Tracker – Data Tools - IEA
- Methane Facts
- 80x more potent in the first 20 years than CO2
- 28 times more powerful when average over 100 years
- Responsible for 25% of today’s warming
- Source: Methane facts and information (NatGeo)

## Slide 43: Notebook 5 Constructing MAC

## Slide 44: MAC: Environmental Defense Fund’s MAC 2.0

- Source: A revamped cost curve for reaching net-zero emissions | Environmental Defense Fund
- Discover: Interactive MAC 2.0
- How is MAC 2.0 different?
- Path-Dependent
- Tech-Dependent
- Cross-Sector Interactions
- Diminishing Marginal Return
- Optimal timing and sequencing of actions

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

You can examine the technology deployment and reductions in annual emissions at a single marginal abatement cost, such as $0 per ton, or in a range of costs, such as $0 to $60 per ton.

From the report: “explicitly incorporating path- dependent, cross-sector interactions, the diminishing returns of marginal measures, and considering measures that become cost-effective when other measures are deployed at scale.”

## Slide 45: Conclusion Part II

- We asked: What are the most cost-effective ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions?
- We answered this by sorting it by marginal abatement costs (the cost of reducing the next ton of CO2 / Methane).
- We observed that the cost of the carbon matters (a lot!).
- Now we need to ask ourselves: How can we use economic policy & theory to drive this reduction? To do so, we need to construct a cost of carbon.

## Slide 46: Part III: 

			Policy: Introducing Emission Taxes vs. Cap-and-trade

- Part III:
- Policy: Introducing Emission Taxes vs. Cap-and-trade

## Slide 47: Class question

- Philosophical question:
- What’s your way of reducing something that is deemed bad?
- Economic answer:
- Taxes (You want to do something ‘bad’ - pay up!)
- Carbon Tax, Methane Tax, Alcohol Tax, Tax my Strada Coffee Cup?
- Quotas (You can only do ‘this much bad’)
- Cap and trade on carbon, methane, sulfuric dioxide

## Slide 48: Policy: Tax policy using MAC

- Set a tax
- Abate this
- Question: Who profits in this deal?

## Slide 49: Policy: C&T MAC curve

- Get a price
- Opportunities to trade?
- Set a cap
- Question: Who profits in this deal?

## Slide 50: Policy: How C&T works at firm-level

## Slide 51: Policy: Cap & Trade vs. Command-and-Control

- How to implement? How has this worked in the past? Connection to MAC?
- Marginal cost of abatement

## Slide 52: Policy: Carbon Tax vs. C&T Illustrated

- Amount of pollution
- Cost of Emission
- Regulator sets amount of emission permits
- Companies trade permits to get to efficient point
- Amount of pollution

## Slide 53: Policy: Global Coverage of Tax & Cap-and-Trade (ETS)

## Slide 54: Policy: Real world examples of Cap-and-Trade

## Slide 55: PM 2.5 Regulation - Nationally and in California

## Slide 56: Pm 2.5 violations - nationally

## Slide 57: Conclusion Part III

- We asked how we can reduce something bad - like pollution!
- We gave an economist answer (I’m sure there’s other ways of doing this) that taxes and/or cap&trade can work.
- We showed how we can intuitively predict / shape policy outcomes by using the MAC.
- Conclusion
- Overall, we’ve looked at historical emissions in time and space. We then looked at the most cost-effective ways of reducing them, and the policy tools we have to do so. This is only the tip of the iceberg of environmental economics, but I hope you’ve enjoyed this lecture!
