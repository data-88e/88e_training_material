  - Tryna figure out grad school options

## Slide 6: Why of the class

- Is Python coding a tool that Economics Students should know?
- Would it make sense to have coding skills for learning in more advanced classes?
- Macro
- Labor
- Development
- Finance
- Can it motivate students when they get to Econometrics?
- To think like data scientist?
- To prepare data for Econometric analysis?
- Is it a skill in the job market - ability to work with data?

## Slide 7: Three goals of Data 88E

- Connect data science with economics
- Prepare students for further coursework and research
- Showcase economic subdomains
- Replicates economics papers using data science
- Surveys core concepts from upper-division coursework
- Learn to use LaTeX and open source data science tools
- Be able to adequately read economics literature
- Examine economics concepts through real-world data
- Utilize data science tools and techniques to conduct analysis
- Motivate econometrics through a data science perspective

## Slide 8: Why Economics & Data Science?

- “If Economics continues to be the major it is now, and Data Science emerges as an alternative, a good chunk of people who are currently going into economics will realize that it makes much more sense to become a Data Science major, with a minor in economics - and I would say they’re making the right choice!”  - Steven Levitt
- “The Data Science tools may well turn out to be in the first half of the 2000s the equivalent of a fine chancery hand was in Oxford or Cambridge in the 1400s, just as a facility with the document formats and commands of the Microsoft office at the end of the 1900s: practical, general skills that make you of immense value to most if not nearly all organizations.”  - Brad DeLong
- “I think Econometrics could use a lot of the techniques that are common in Data Science, such as bootstrapping…techniques for data-driven procedures and there’s a lot of really creative ideas in terms of presenting data …”  - David Card
- “I write Jupyter Notebooks, I write Python, try my models out in Python, and it’s very empowering…I think the students at Berkeley are lucky..  The things you have now!  ”  - Thomas Sargent
- “During the pandemic, you could track comfort with social interactions using Open Table reservations. I don't have to tell you all how closely you can track rents in pricey Bay Area neighborhoods using tools like Zillow, Apartments.com, and Apartment List. These types of housing data inform the Federal Reserve's understanding of inflation. I am confident your generation will transform our capability to use high-frequency, real-time data, applying your unique perspectives to deepen our understanding of how our economy is evolving.” - Lisa Cook
