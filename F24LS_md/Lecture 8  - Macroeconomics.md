## Slide 6: Inflation

- Inflation measures how much prices change over time
- Typically captured by the CPI (Consumer Price Index), which looks at a fixed basket of the same goods and sees how they go up or down relative to a base year.
- Other indices include the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) or Fisher Price Index
- Does anybody know what inflation is today?
- In 1980, inflation was approximately 14.5%
- In 2000, inflation hovered around 3.5%

Unemployment Rate -  NEED TO REDO

</details>

## Slide 10: Unemployment Rate

- The unemployment rate tells us the percentage of people in the labour force who are willing and able to work but can‚Äôt find a job
- Unemployment hit a record high during the heart of the coronavirus pandemic
- Data is collected by the Bureau of Labour Statistics
- On the first Friday of every month, the BLS releases employment statistics
- It has huuuuge impacts on bond markets, inflationary pressures, and GDP forecasts
- Surprise effect is what it is important!
- NAIRU = Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Full time students, people who are retired, people who arent looking for a job

Real GDP  NEED TO REDO

</details>

## Slide 12: Gross Domestic Product

- Captures how much a given country produces in a given year
- Output = Consumption + Investment + Government expenditures + Net exports
- Y = C + I + G + NX
- We are most interested in analyzing Real GDP.  What does ‚Äúreal‚Äù mean?
- What is the United States GDP? China?
- What are the GDP‚Äôs of developing countries like Chad?

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

US 21 trillion. Cares Act was a 2.2 trillion package, so about 10% of US GDP
China 15 trillion
Chad 10 billion

Federal Funds Rate -  NEED TO REDO

</details>

## Slide 14: Federal Funds Rate

- Two intuitive ways to think about interest rates
- -    Represent the cost of borrowing
- Can also be thought of as the opportunity cost of holding cash
- Adjusting the target FFR is one of the main ways that central banks enact monetary policy. We‚Äôll touch more on this later
- Go down to ‚Äúheat up‚Äù the economy, and go up to ‚Äúcool it off‚Äù
- This is what‚Äôs known as expansionary vs contractionary monetary policy
- Fisher equation: real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation

## Slide 15: How interest rates affects output, unemployment and inflation

- Federal Funds Rate (FFR)
- What happens to investment if the FFR decreases? Think cost of borrowing
- What happens to savings if the FFR decreases?
- How do we expect output to change if the FFR decreases?
- Recall our formula for GDP Y=C+I+G+NX

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Ask the audience the last question, if no one answers then proceed by answering it myself, 

GDP Y=C+I+G+NX (If rates decrease, then C and I go up)
Consumption - save less money because of lower rates
Net Exports (NX):
Currency Value: Lower interest rates generally lead to a depreciation of the local currency because lower rates decrease the returns on assets denominated in that currency, making it less attractive to foreign investors. A weaker currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, potentially increasing net exports.
Competitiveness: As the local currency depreciates, domestic goods and services become cheaper for foreigners, boosting exports. Conversely, foreign goods become more expensive for domestic consumers, potentially reducing imports.

</details>

## Slide 16: How interest rates affect output, unemployment and inflation

- What happens to investment if the FFR decreases? Increases!
- What happens to saving if the FFR decreases? Decreases!
- How do we expect output to change if the FFR decreases? Increases!
- Without any external events (ceteris paribus):
- Fed decreases FFR ‚Üí real interest rate r decreases (Fisher equation)
- ‚Üí Investment increases and savings decrease (it becomes cheaper to borrow and less attractive to save)
- ‚Üí Output inputs and unemployment decreases (investment sparks production, creating jobs)
- ‚Üí Wage inflation increases (firms must raise wages to attract workers in a competitive labour market) ‚Üí Inflation increases
- TLDR: ‚Üìr ‚Üí ‚Üë Y ‚Üí ‚Üìu ‚Üí‚Üëùúã

## Slide 20: We see these indicators all over the news today!

## Slide 21: Terms you might hear in the news

- Hawks vs Doves:
- Hawks favor high interest rates to keep inflation under control
- Doves worry that high rates can induce a recession. They want to keep rates low to encourage spending in the economy
- Paul Volcker: He was the Fed Chair from 1979-1987. He is a Hawk and famous for hiking interest rates in the 80s, and also being really tall. People draw comparisons between him and Jay Powell as of late
- Pivot: When the Fed shifts its monetary policy from contractionary to expansionary and vice versa
- Soft Landing: A gradual decline in production and activity that avoids triggering a recession. This is the Federal Reserve‚Äôs goal!
- Hard Landing: Think airplane. Occurs when there is a sudden harsh decline in growth and production. There is worry that we are headed towards one

- IS Curve

## Slide 36: Phillips Curve

- Phillips Curve describes the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment: Inflation is higher when unemployment is low and lower when unemployment is high.
- where      is the inflation rate,                    is
- the unemployment gap.
- The original curve drawn for pre-WW1 data (1851-1913) by A.W. Phillips

## Slide 37: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- In the labor market, firms demand for labor, and workers supply labor. What will happen if demand for labor increases? Will firms pay more in order to hire new workers?

## Slide 38: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- In the labor market, firms demand for labor, and workers supply labor. What will happen if demand for labor increases? Will firms pay more in order to hire new workers?

## Slide 39: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- When the demand for labor increases, the pool of unemployed workers subsequently decreases and companies increase wages to compete and attract a smaller talent pool. The cost of wages increases and companies pass along those costs to consumers in the form of price increases. Thus, a lower unemployment rate ultimately translates to a higher inflation.

## Slide 40: Phillips Curve

- Think about the opposite direction.
- What will happen if the demand of labor decreases? Will the equilibrium wages increase or decrease? How will this affect the price of goods?

## Slide 41: Phillips Curve

- Let‚Äôs see some data we can work with!

## Slide 46: Phillips Curve

- How will the ‚ÄúPhillips Curve‚Äù look like if we use data for the recent decade?

## Slide 47: Phillips Curve

- How will the ‚ÄúPhillips Curve‚Äù look like if we use data for the recent decade?

## Slide 48: Phillips Curve

- Many call this the ‚Äúflattening of the Phillips Curve‚Äù.

## Slide 49: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- What economists initially failed to realize in constructing the Phillips curve was that people and firms take the expected level of inflation into account when deciding how much to produce and how much to consume. When workers expect prices to rise, they demand higher wages. When firms expect costs to rise, they set higher prices.
- where      is the inflation rate,         is the expected inflation rate,                  is the unemployment gap.

## Slide 50: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- Intuitions:
- Current the inflation rate is 3.7% (CPI, Oct 2023).
- When making labor contracts, would you take into account this expected rising living cost and demand higher wages?
- When making investments, would you take into account this expected inflation and demand higher nominal returns (for example, demand higher nominal interest rate for deposits)?

## Slide 51: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- How will this impact policy to combat inflation?
- To control inflation, we need to ‚Äúanchor‚Äù people‚Äôs inflation expectation first.

## Slide 52: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- How does this hold in reality?

## Slide 78: The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. [‚Ä¶] The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. 

Federal Open Market Committee, 11/5/20

- The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. [‚Ä¶] The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

## Slide 79: What tools aside from changing the FFR does the Fed have to combat an economic downturn?

## Slide 80: Quantitative Easing (QE)

- ‚ÄúIn addition, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.‚Äù

## Slide 81: What is QE?

- Goal: Increase the money supply and provide banks with liquidity, allowing them to increase lending, while decreasing risk (lower risk premia) and uncertainty in the market

## Slide 87: How to use the FRED API

- The mystery graphs we showed at the beginning can be easily reproduced on the FRED website
- If we want to do more complex data analysis, we could download CSVs, but there‚Äôs also a way to set up an API so that you can retrieve the most up to date data in real time.
- Onto the the Jupyter notebook!
