## Slide 1: Data 88E: Economic Models

- Lecture 4: Public
- Welfare & Government Intervention

## Slide 2: Announcements

- Lab 3 will be released today. It is due  Tuesday September 25 11:59pm
- Project 1 is due Tuesday September 25 11:59pm

  - DON’T USE CHAT GPT  for CODE or TEXT ANSWERS
- Project 1
- Air BNB
- Is a little bit longer - get started

## Slide 3: Python Reference

- https://www.data8.org/fa24/reference/

## Slide 4: Announcements

  - Got a few submissions for Lab 1 who used ChatGPT
- It’s super obvious
- The answer was much more complicated, used other techniques than we use in class
- Data 8 syntax is 2-3 lines of code
- Wrong package

## Slide 5: Meme of the week

- student during the school year
- student  during summer internship

## Slide 6: Welfare Analysis - Consumer and Producer Surplus

- A consumer surplus is the aggregate (across all consumers) difference between willingness to pay and actual price paid.
- A producer surplus is the aggregate (across all producers) difference between willingness to receive and actual price received.
- E.g. If the supply curve decreases, the units originally purchased at a higher price will still be purchased now at a lower price. This price difference is a surplus.

## Slide 7: Switch to first part of Lecture Notebook -

- Check out Lecture notebook and let’s walk through the example from Class Demand Lecture

## Slide 8: Lecture Notebook on Surplus

- Histogram of Surplus

## Slide 12: (Consumption) Taxes

- We will consider only taxes levied on consumption today. These are typically enforced on a state level in the US.
- Typically they take a few forms:
- Excise tax: Dollar amount, e.g. 1 dollar per pack of cigarettes
- Ad valorem tax (sales tax): % amount, e.g. 9% sales tax

## Slide 13: Why Tax? (or provide Subsidies?)

- Negative externalities: true cost not reflected in the market transacted price
- E.g. Pollution, traffic congestion, passive smoking
- These costs spillover to others!
- Marginal private cost < marginal social cost (overproduction)
- Positive externalities: true benefit not reflected in the market transacted price
- E.g. education, vaccines, Ed questions (public goods)
- These benefits spillover to others!
- Marginal private benefit < marginal social benefit

## Slide 14: An aside: Ed

- Answering and posting questions is a public good with positive externalities; the market under supplies the good.
- What is a public good? 2 important attributes:
- Non-rivalrous: One’s use of the good does not affect another’s use
- Non-excludable: We cannot prevent anyone from benefiting from the good
- To correct for positive externalities, typically the government will provide subsidies.
- Now a couple of people are answering questions on Ed - YAY!

## Slide 15: Positive Externality

## Slide 16: Negative Externality

## Slide 17: Tax on Cigarettes

## Slide 18: Tax to reduce a Negative Externality

## Slide 19: Externalities Graphed

- Negative Externality
- Positive Externality
- Which good is underproduced? Which good is overproduced?
- Supply Side
- Demand Side

## Slide 20: A technicality on variables

- Pc := price consumer pays
- Pp := price producer receives
- Pc = Pp + tax
- Quantity demanded: D(Pc)
- Quantity supplied: S(Pp)
- In previous weeks without tax, Pc = Pp (which we denoted as P for short), and equilibrium was such that D(Pc) = S(Pp).
- However, this changes when a third player -- the government -- is introduced!

## Slide 21: Expressing Taxes Mathematically

- If the Demand Curve is given by D(Pc) = 2000 - 20Pc and a 4 dollar sales tax is implemented on the consumer, what is the new demand curve?
- If the Supply Curve is given by S(Pp) = 200 + 15 Pp and a 4 dollar tax is implemented on the producer, what is the new supply curve?
- D(Pc) = 2000 - 20(Pp+4) = 2000 - 20Pp - 80 = 1920 - 20Pp
- S(Pp) = 200 + 15 (Pc-4)  = 200 + 15Pc - 60 = 140 + 15Pc
- Pp: amount received by producer
- Pp+4: amount paid by consumer (Pc)
- Pc-4: amount received by producer (Pp)
- Pc: amount paid by consumer

## Slide 22: Graphing Taxes

- Mathematically, a tax is a shift in the supply/demand curve due to a change in the intercept.
- A tax allows us to correct for negative externalities by charging the marginal social cost curve!

## Slide 23: Graphing Taxes (supply side)

- Quantity transacted falls from Q to Q’
  - Pc paid by consumers
  - Pp received by producers
  - Tax = Pc - Pp
- CS and PS are reduced
- Deadweight loss: area of surplus that no longer exists, due to less units being transacted

## Slide 24: Incidence of Tax

- Statutory Incidence: the side that is legally responsible for paying the tax
- Economic Incidence: side that bears the burden of the tax.
- We can measure who bears the burden of the tax by comparing the amount being received/paid by producers/consumers to the original price.
- Statutory incidence is independent of economic incidence!
- i.e. a tax that is levied on consumers will have the same burden as the same tax levied on producers.

## Slide 25: Economic Incidence Depends on Elasticities

- Inelastic Demand
- Elastic Demand
- If demand is more elastic, will consumers or producers bear more of the burden of the tax?

## Slide 26: An Example (I)

- The demand for rutabagas is:
- D(Pc) = 2000 − 100Pc
- The supply of rutabagas is:
- S(Pp) = −100 + 200Pp
- What is the equilibrium price without the tax?

## Slide 27: An Example (I)

- The demand for rutabagas is:
- D(Pc) = 2000 − 100Pc
- The supply of rutabagas is:
- S(Pp) = −100 + 200Pp
- What is the equilibrium price without the tax?
- Pp = Pc = P
- 2000 - 100P = -100 + 200 P
- P = 7

## Slide 28: An Example (II)

- What is the equilibrium price with a per unit $2 sales tax?

## Slide 29: An Example (II)

- What is the equilibrium price with a per unit $2 sales tax?
- 2000 - 100Pc = -100 + 200 Pp
- 2000 - 100(Pp+2) = -100 + 200Pp
- Pp = 6.33
- Pc = 6.33 + 2 = 8.33

## Slide 30: An Example (III)

- What are the tax burdens on the consumer and producer?

## Slide 31: An Example (III)

- What are the tax burdens on the consumer and producer?
- Consumer: New price paid - Old price paid = 8.33 - 7 = 1.33
- Producer: Old price received - New price received = 7 - 6.33 = 0.67
- The consumer bears ⅔ of the total burden of the tax

## Slide 32: An Example (IV)

- What is change in quantity transacted due to the tax?

## Slide 33: An Example (IV)

- What is change in quantity transacted due to the tax?
- Originally, Q = 2000 - 100Pc = 2000 - 100\*7 = 1300
- Now, Q = 2000 - 100Pc = 2000 - 100\*8.33 = 1167
- 1300 - 1167 = 133
- We can also plug in Pp into the supply equation and get the same results

## Slide 34: Let’s put it all together in the Notebook - with sliders

## Slide 35: Graph 1

## Slide 36: Graph 1 - sliders  with 3 questions

- Price Start does nothing
- Supply shifts Slope
- Demand shifts Intercept
- Intercept shift - no change in shares
- Slope Shifts - change in relative shares

## Slide 37: Lab - Are Consumers Aware of Taxes?

- Raj Chetty, Adam Looney, and Kory Kroft (AER 2010) seek to answer this
- “We find that posting tax-inclusive price tags reduces demand by 8 percent.”
- US vs Europe?

## Slide 38: Journal article

- Raj Chetty was at Berkeley
- 2003-2009

## Slide 39: Reproducibility

- AER website

## Slide 40: Dataset in replication repository

## Slide 41: Replication Data   ( ~2009 version)

## Slide 42: Price Controls

- Price Ceilings
- Forcibly lower prices:
- price ceiling < equilibrium price
- Creates a shortage
- E.g. rent control
- Price Floors
- Forcible raise prices
- price floor > equilibrium price
- Creates a surplus
- E.g. minimum wage

## Slide 43: World Trade vs. Autarky

- Autarky: A state of economic self-sufficiency
- World trade: constant world price is introduced to the market
- What happens to: consumer surplus? Producer surplus? Total surplus?

## Slide 44: What are the benefits of free trade?

- Increases consumer surplus
- Can increase GDP and drive growth
- Encourages specialization
- Increases efficiency and tech transfer
- Encourages innovation
