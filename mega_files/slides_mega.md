- Is a little bit longer - get started

## Slide 3: Python Reference

- https://www.data8.org/fa24/reference/

## Slide 4: Announcements

  - Got a few submissions for Lab 1 who used ChatGPT
- It’s super obvious
- The answer was much more complicated, used other techniques than we use in class
- Data 8 syntax is 2-3 lines of code
- Wrong package

## Slide 5: Meme of the week

- student during the school year
- student  during summer internship

## Slide 6: Welfare Analysis - Consumer and Producer Surplus

- A consumer surplus is the aggregate (across all consumers) difference between willingness to pay and actual price paid.
- A producer surplus is the aggregate (across all producers) difference between willingness to receive and actual price received.
- E.g. If the supply curve decreases, the units originally purchased at a higher price will still be purchased now at a lower price. This price difference is a surplus.

## Slide 7: Switch to first part of Lecture Notebook -

- Check out Lecture notebook and let’s walk through the example from Class Demand Lecture

## Slide 8: Lecture Notebook on Surplus

- Histogram of Surplus
- Counting up
- Graphing a surplus triangle

## Slide 9: (untitled)

## Slide 10: (untitled)

## Slide 11: (untitled)

## Slide 12: (Consumption) Taxes

- We will consider only taxes levied on consumption today. These are typically enforced on a state level in the US.
- Typically they take a few forms:
- Excise tax: Dollar amount, e.g. 1 dollar per pack of cigarettes
- Ad valorem tax (sales tax): % amount, e.g. 9% sales tax

## Slide 13: Why Tax? (or provide Subsidies?)

- Negative externalities: true cost not reflected in the market transacted price
- E.g. Pollution, traffic congestion, passive smoking
- These costs spillover to others!
- Marginal private cost < marginal social cost (overproduction)
- Positive externalities: true benefit not reflected in the market transacted price
- E.g. education, vaccines, Ed questions (public goods)
- These benefits spillover to others!
- Marginal private benefit < marginal social benefit

## Slide 14: An aside: Ed

- Answering and posting questions is a public good with positive externalities; the market under supplies the good.
- What is a public good? 2 important attributes:
- Non-rivalrous: One’s use of the good does not affect another’s use
- Non-excludable: We cannot prevent anyone from benefiting from the good
- To correct for positive externalities, typically the government will provide subsidies.
- Now a couple of people are answering questions on Ed - YAY!

## Slide 15: Positive Externality

## Slide 16: Negative Externality

## Slide 17: Tax on Cigarettes

## Slide 18: Tax to reduce a Negative Externality

## Slide 19: Externalities Graphed

- Negative Externality
- Positive Externality
- Which good is underproduced? Which good is overproduced?
- Supply Side
- Demand Side

## Slide 20: A technicality on variables

- Pc := price consumer pays
- Pp := price producer receives
- Pc = Pp + tax
- Quantity demanded: D(Pc)
- Quantity supplied: S(Pp)
- In previous weeks without tax, Pc = Pp (which we denoted as P for short), and equilibrium was such that D(Pc) = S(Pp).
- However, this changes when a third player -- the government -- is introduced!

## Slide 21: Expressing Taxes Mathematically

- If the Demand Curve is given by D(Pc) = 2000 - 20Pc and a 4 dollar sales tax is implemented on the consumer, what is the new demand curve?
- If the Supply Curve is given by S(Pp) = 200 + 15 Pp and a 4 dollar tax is implemented on the producer, what is the new supply curve?
- D(Pc) = 2000 - 20(Pp+4) = 2000 - 20Pp - 80 = 1920 - 20Pp
- S(Pp) = 200 + 15 (Pc-4)  = 200 + 15Pc - 60 = 140 + 15Pc
- Pp: amount received by producer
- Pp+4: amount paid by consumer (Pc)
- Pc-4: amount received by producer (Pp)
- Pc: amount paid by consumer

## Slide 22: Graphing Taxes

- Mathematically, a tax is a shift in the supply/demand curve due to a change in the intercept.
- A tax allows us to correct for negative externalities by charging the marginal social cost curve!

## Slide 23: Graphing Taxes (supply side)

- Quantity transacted falls from Q to Q’
  - Pc paid by consumers
  - Pp received by producers
  - Tax = Pc - Pp
- CS and PS are reduced
- Deadweight loss: area of surplus that no longer exists, due to less units being transacted

## Slide 24: Incidence of Tax

- Statutory Incidence: the side that is legally responsible for paying the tax
- Economic Incidence: side that bears the burden of the tax.
- We can measure who bears the burden of the tax by comparing the amount being received/paid by producers/consumers to the original price.
- Statutory incidence is independent of economic incidence!
- i.e. a tax that is levied on consumers will have the same burden as the same tax levied on producers.

## Slide 25: Economic Incidence Depends on Elasticities

- Inelastic Demand
- Elastic Demand
- If demand is more elastic, will consumers or producers bear more of the burden of the tax?

## Slide 26: An Example (I)

- The demand for rutabagas is:
- D(Pc) = 2000 − 100Pc
- The supply of rutabagas is:
- S(Pp) = −100 + 200Pp
- What is the equilibrium price without the tax?

## Slide 27: An Example (I)

- The demand for rutabagas is:
- D(Pc) = 2000 − 100Pc
- The supply of rutabagas is:
- S(Pp) = −100 + 200Pp
- What is the equilibrium price without the tax?
- Pp = Pc = P
- 2000 - 100P = -100 + 200 P
- P = 7

## Slide 28: An Example (II)

- What is the equilibrium price with a per unit $2 sales tax?

## Slide 29: An Example (II)

- What is the equilibrium price with a per unit $2 sales tax?
- 2000 - 100Pc = -100 + 200 Pp
- 2000 - 100(Pp+2) = -100 + 200Pp
- Pp = 6.33
- Pc = 6.33 + 2 = 8.33

## Slide 30: An Example (III)

- What are the tax burdens on the consumer and producer?

## Slide 31: An Example (III)

- What are the tax burdens on the consumer and producer?
- Consumer: New price paid - Old price paid = 8.33 - 7 = 1.33
- Producer: Old price received - New price received = 7 - 6.33 = 0.67
- The consumer bears ⅔ of the total burden of the tax

## Slide 32: An Example (IV)

- What is change in quantity transacted due to the tax?

## Slide 33: An Example (IV)

- What is change in quantity transacted due to the tax?
- Originally, Q = 2000 - 100Pc = 2000 - 100\*7 = 1300
- Now, Q = 2000 - 100Pc = 2000 - 100\*8.33 = 1167
- 1300 - 1167 = 133
- We can also plug in Pp into the supply equation and get the same results

## Slide 34: Let’s put it all together in the Notebook - with sliders

## Slide 35: Graph 1

## Slide 36: Graph 1 - sliders  with 3 questions

- Price Start does nothing
- Supply shifts Slope
- Demand shifts Intercept
- Intercept shift - no change in shares
- Slope Shifts - change in relative shares

## Slide 37: Lab - Are Consumers Aware of Taxes?

- Raj Chetty, Adam Looney, and Kory Kroft (AER 2010) seek to answer this
- “We find that posting tax-inclusive price tags reduces demand by 8 percent.”
- US vs Europe?

## Slide 38: Journal article

- Raj Chetty was at Berkeley
- 2003-2009

## Slide 39: Reproducibility

- AER website

## Slide 40: Dataset in replication repository

## Slide 41: Replication Data   ( ~2009 version)

## Slide 42: Price Controls

- Price Ceilings
- Forcibly lower prices:
- price ceiling < equilibrium price
- Creates a shortage
- E.g. rent control
- Price Floors
- Forcible raise prices
- price floor > equilibrium price
- Creates a surplus
- E.g. minimum wage

## Slide 43: World Trade vs. Autarky

- Autarky: A state of economic self-sufficiency
- World trade: constant world price is introduced to the market
- What happens to: consumer surplus? Producer surplus? Total surplus?

## Slide 44: What are the benefits of free trade?

- Increases consumer surplus
- Can increase GDP and drive growth
- Encourages specialization
- Increases efficiency and tech transfer
- Encourages innovation

## Slide 1: Data 88E: Economic Models

- Lecture 1: Introduction and Overview

## Slide 2: A fun aside - the logo derived from stonks meme

## Slide 3: TL;DR of the course

- Examine economics concepts through real-world data and data science methods.
- Motivate economics topics through modeling
- Practice Python skills while learning economics concepts.
- 9th time being offered!

## Slide 4: Jupyter as inspiration

- Almost everything you’ll do will be in Jupyter, using Python.
- Textbook
- The textbook is compiled and structured via Jupyter Books, with each page written using Jupyter Notebooks
- Interactivity
- Jupyter Notebooks facilitates interactive computing, encouraging learning by doing and tinkering. This applies to the textbook too!
- Data Centric
- Jupyter Notebooks were built to conduct data analysis.
- The course is an open source project  - you too can collaborate!

## Slide 5: Why should I take this course?

- Student Instructors: We built this course to be a class that we wish we could’ve taken when we were Freshmen or Sophomores. Essentially, it’s everything related to data science & economics that we wish we would’ve known a couple years ago.
- This course will:
- Prepare students for upper division economics courses and research.
- Apply data science, computation, and visualization techniques to the field of economics based on real world data.
- Survey economics subdomains including financial economics, development economics, macroeconomic policy, econometrics, and more.
- Motivate modeling, the use of tools and techniques, explore the intersection of economics and data science.

## Slide 6: Prerequisites

- Data 8, or some basic programming/data science equivalent (e.g. STAT 20 w/ R).
- It will be harder to follow on, and succeed, if you do not have Data 8.
- Specifically there is a package  datascience
- with Table commands
- Economics coursework is not necessary, but will be helpful.
- Python experience will be fundamental
- If you are a Concurrent Enrollment student - you may have to decide for yourself!
- Look at last year’s class assignments
- Look at Data 8 assignments

## Slide 7: What is a connector course?

- The design of the course is for 1st/2nd year students - who are currently or recently taken Data 8  - https://www.data8.org/
- Linked to topics and pace of Data 8
- Connectors give a domain specific application of Data 8 toolset
- If you haven’t taken Data 8 - the Data 8 textbook is also useful
  - https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html
- There is a lot behind these materials that we weren’t able to fit into the course.
- Find a study group - come to office hours
- Ask questions on Ed for other students to answer?

## Slide 8: Will I be challenged?

- If you are a junior/senior with a programming background or have taken advanced upper division Econ classes, this course will be pretty easy. As a result, we expect you to:
- Go above and beyond in the labs, dig into the programming and routines beyond just clicking through the notebooks.
- Read the papers behind the materials in the class.
- Think about the limitations in our presented methods.
- Use these labs as a starting point and try some programming on your own.
- There is a lot behind these materials that we weren’t able to fit into the course.
- Help other students out - You can learn by teaching!
- We get scores from Ed discussions on who answers other’s questions

## Slide 9: You better help other students

- You better help other students

## Slide 10: A Caveat

- This class a work in progress - while we’ve offered it for several semesters now, we’re still looking to continue improving on the content!
- Basically it’s complicated, lots of complicated labs
- You will help to participate, give feedback, and improve the course!
- Hybrid Instruction in uncertain times - we have no idea how the semester will play out:  Omicron, COVID, Power Shutoff, People’s Park

## Slide 11: Fall Semester Hex - back in my day

## Slide 12: Data Paradise

- You will be in data paradise this semester. We will largely clean the data for you.
- After this class, expect to experience Paradise Lost.
- “[Data scientist] respondents reported they spent most of their time cleaning data (60 percent), and [noted the] task to be the least enjoyable part of their job (57 percent).”
- We would’ve liked to teach data cleaning as well in this course, but there simply wasn’t enough time :(

## Slide 13: Expectations for in person instruction

- This class is planned being taught in person. In case you cannot make it to class due to an emergency, please make a private Ed post explaining why by 11:59 pm on the Tuesday before lecture. If your excuse is legitimate, we will give an alternative method for you to make up the lecture.
- DO NOT COME if you are sick

## Slide 14: Student Instruction!

- This class is created by students who were interested in these topics.
- Students teach some of the classes! Or part of the classes!

- Observational Studies
- You can measure correlation
- But you can’t measure causation unless you can control for all confounding variables
- Experimental Design ( Project 3)

  - Technology adoption
  - Behavior changes around technology
- Objective outcome measures

## Slide 44: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)  in Economics

- Also called Impact Evaluation
- Effectiveness of Aid – interest to measure impacts of
- international projects, health interventions, schooling, welfare

- Causality cannot be determined in observational studies
- Compare to a control group - a counterfactual - a comparison group
- Endogeneity of economic choices - Remove Selection Bias!
- In an observational study you cannot separate correlation from causality – because of factors involving  selection into the treatment. Those who sign up are different from those who do not

- Project demo
- Upper division econometrics classes

## Slide 9: Memes of the day

## Slide 10: Intro to econometrics

- An important part of economics is understanding the relationship between variables, especially cause-and-effect relationships
  - How does price affect the quantity demanded?
  - How does income tax affect consumption?
  - How does schooling affect income?
- Ideally, we would do randomized controlled trials to see if one variable (independent variable) causes another (dependent variable): gold standard for establishing causality
- But we can’t usually conduct experiments in economics, the best we have is observational data
  - What do you think are some challenges with conducting experiments in economics?
- This is why we use econometrics: we use statistical techniques (like regression) to model relationships between economic variables

## Slide 11: Intro to regression

- Really important tool in econometrics
- Used for modelling relationships between variables
  - E.g. relationship between price and quantity demanded
- 3 main purposes of regression:
  - Describing associations: What kind of association do x and y have? Positive/negative? Strong/weak?
  - Prediction: E.g. by how much will quantity demanded decrease if price increases by $1?
  - Causal inference: Does x cause y or is it just a correlation?

## Slide 12: Simple linear regression

- You hypothesize that there’s some association between two variables – say price and quantity demanded
- Start by creating a scatter plot to visualize the association
  - This gives you an intuition for the association
  - Gives you a sense for whether the association is positive/negative, strong/weak/none
  - There is some randomness: e.g. in the example, y doesn’t always increase as x increases (otherwise the points would all lie on a straight line)

## Slide 13: Simple linear regression

- You can quantify this association by calculating the correlation coefficient or r (DATA 8 review!)
- Review of correlation coefficient:
  - Measure of linear association (won’t work for nonlinear association), i.e. slope is constant with respect to x
  - Value between -1 and 1
  - The sign tells you the direction of the association: positive or negative
  - Take absolute value of r to determine strength of association
  - 0 means no correlation
  - Correlation is not causation!

## Slide 14: Simple linear regression

- How to calculate the correlation coefficient:
  - Step 1: Convert data to standard units
    - Express each value in terms of the number of standard deviations it is from the mean (“distance” from the mean)
  - Step 2: Take the mean of product of x and y

## Slide 15: Simple linear regression

- We can draw a line of best fit through the data: the line that most accurately models the relationship between x and y
- Recall that this line has the form y = slope \* x + intercept
- We can use the correlation coefficient to find the slope and intercept
  - Slope:
  - Intercept:
  - Equation of the line of best fit:                                 → Regression equation
- A note notation: the hats indicate that the values are estimates (rather than actual values)
- (fact: because average of x and y are always on the regression line)

## Slide 16: Simple linear regression

- Can plot the regression line (the line of best fit) using the equation we found
- This is the same as the line of best fit you get by using a function you already looked at: np.polyfit
- Not all the points lie on the regression line because of
  - Random variation
  - The model is not a perfect fit (not perfectly accurate)
- Note: assuming all assumptions of doing linear regression are satisfied

## Slide 17: Avocado Demand in Week 2?   np.polyfit(X,Y,1)

## Slide 18: polyfit

## Slide 19: Simple linear regression

- Use the regression equation to generate predictions for y
- Once we’ve generated predictions, we would be interested in knowing how accurate they are
- We can calculate root mean squared error (RMSE) to determine accuracy:
  - Calculate residuals → Square them → Take the average → Take the square root

## Slide 20: Simple linear regression

- RMSE: on average, how far are your predictions from the actual values?
  - Think about whether your value for RMSE is a large number
  - Most useful for comparing across models
- Regression minimizes the RMSE of your data: of all the lines you can draw through your points, the regression line has the lowest RMSE
  - This is why it’s called least squares (OLS) regression
  - We can use the minimize() function to see this
- Numpy minimizes RMSE when it’s calculating the slope and intercept (e.g. when you use np.polyfit)

## Slide 21: Simple linear regression

- So far: DATA 8 version of regression
- We use the statsmodels library to do regression in Python
  - First, import statsmodels.api as sm
  - Code for regression:
  - To get the coefficients (intercept, slope): result.params

## Slide 22: (untitled)

## Slide 23: Simple linear regression

- Always include intercept term in your model (that is, don’t forget sm.add\_constant)
  - Regression line passes through point of averages (property of the regression line)
  - Best prediction for the average of x is the average of y
  - Including the intercept term makes sure that your regression line passes through the point of averages
  - Also, can’t generally assume that your model doesn’t have a y-intercept

## Slide 24: Simple linear regression

- Important things to focus on in the regression output:
  - Slope (𝛃) : By how much does y increase/decrease when you increase x by 1 unit?
  - Intercept (𝛂) : What is the value of y when x = 0?
    - Not always meaningful (e.g. what are earnings when height is 0 inches?)
  - Confidence interval: Is there a statistically significant association between x and y? (H0: 𝛃 = 0, H1: 𝛃 ≠ 0)

## Slide 25: Simple linear regression

- Confidence interval on coefficient estimates:
  - Related to hypothesis testing:
    - Null hypothesis: No association between x and y  (𝛃=0)
    - Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between x and y (𝛃≠0)
  - Regression output gives you 95% CI → test hypotheses at the 5% significance level
    - If CI contains 0: evidence for the null
    - If CI doesn’t contain 0: evidence against the null
  - Can simulate using bootstrapping
    - Center of the CI: regression slope

## Slide 26: Regression Output ( Statsmodels)

## Slide 27: Regression Output ( SM vs R vs Stata)

- Python (statsmodels)
- R - LM
- Stata

## Slide 28: Regression Output ( Statsmodels)

- This is the amount of variation explained by the model
- Number of Observations - reality check on size of data  N matters!
- coef = 𝛃 = magnitude of estimated coefficient
- std err = variability of estimate of coefficient
- t=  a t-test testing whether 𝛃 = 0
- P>[t]=  probability of that t-test

## Slide 29: Jump to Notebook 1

## Slide 30: Interactive Demo

## Slide 31: (untitled)

## Slide 32: (untitled)

## Slide 33: Multiple linear regression

- These variables that affect the dependent variable and are correlated with the independent variable that are not included in the model are called omitted variables
  - E.g. your socioeconomic background affects your earnings and is positively correlated with how much education you get
- They cause omitted variable bias: cause your estimate of the regression slope to be different from the actual slope
  - What would a positive vs. negative value for omitted variable bias mean?
- Can use multiple linear regression to account for omitted variables (really important purpose of regression!)

## Slide 34: Multiple linear regression

- These variables that affect the dependent variable and are correlated with the independent variable that are not included in the model are called omitted variables
  - E.g. your socioeconomic background affects your earnings and is positively correlated with how much education you get
- They cause omitted variable bias: cause your estimate of the regression slope to be different from the actual slope
- Can use multiple linear regression to account for omitted variables

## Slide 35: Multiple linear regression

- Using statsmodels: just select multiple columns when defining the x-variable
  - Multiple regression slopes: each independent variable has a slope
- Compare slope on independent variable of interest from simple and multiple linear regression to see if it’s overstated or understated
- Example of a MLR model:

## Slide 36: Multiple linear regression

- Mathematical intuition:
- Each slope is the partial effect of the corresponding independent variable on y: effect holding all other independent variables constant

## Slide 37: Multiple linear regression

- Graphically with 2 independent variables: 3D plot with a regression plane (not line)
- Y
- X1 - continuous variable
- X2 - dummy variable
- Can only be 0,1

## Slide 38: Dummy variables

- Dummy variables are variables that take on a value of either 0 or 1 to indicate the presence or absence in a category
  - E.g. smoker or non-smoker, went to college or didn’t go to college
- Also known as indicator variables
- Mutually exclusive: you can only be in one of the categories (you either went to college or you didn’t – not both)
- Collectively exhaustive: you must be in one of the categories (only 2 possible scenarios)

## Slide 39: Dummy variables

- Example of regression model with dummy variable:
  - col is a dummy variable indicating whether or not the person went to college (0 = didn’t go to college)
  - Coefficient on col → difference of mean earnings when col = 1 and col = 0

## Slide 40: Dummy variables

- Beware of the dummy variable trap
- Say you include all possible variables for a dummy variable
  - E.g. col (for whether or not you went to college) and notcol (for whether or not you didn’t go to college)
  - Example:

## Slide 41: Dummy variables

- There are infinite solutions for the coefficients (slopes and intercepts)
- This is because the independent variable in the model have a perfect correlation – perfect multicollinearity
- Happens any time one independent variable is a linear combination of another
  - E.g. if you have age and schooling in your model and age = schooling + 3
- Use pd.get\_dummies() to convert categorical variables to dummy variables

## Slide 42: Jump to Lec NB2

## Slide 43: Reading econometrics tables

- In papers, the results of econometric analysis are summarized in regression tables
- Example of regression table from project 4:

## Slide 44: Reading econometrics tables

- In papers, the results of econometric analysis are summarized in regression tables
- Example of regression table from project 4:
- Filtering Variable
- X1
- X2
- X3,X4,X5…
- Y
- n

## Slide 45: Reading econometrics tables

- Always look at how the dependent variable is being measured: in the example, the authors are taking log earnings
  - Recall what you learned about semi-log demand curves: interpreted as % change in y per unit change in x
- Look at what is being controlled for, e.g.
  - They are estimating separate models for men and women so they are controlling for gender
  - In the second column for each group, they are controlling for test scores

## Slide 46: Project demo

- In this project, you will use regression to analyze the relationship between a person’s height and earnings
- Based on a study conducted by Anne Case and Christina Paxson (very interesting study!)
- Divided into 3 parts: simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and reading econometrics tables

## Slide 48: Aside - Econometrics vs ML

- The idea of Econometrics is that the model has an underlying structure
- Economic Theory gives us a reason to structure the model
- We seek to explain the effect of X on Y
- We also need to hold multiple variables constant
- We will adapt a lot of techniques to get an unbiased estimator
- OLS is the starting point - variations depart from there
- Machine Learning - we don’t need to have an underlying model
- Whatever does the best job in prediction! Or modeling, or classification...
- ML has many models that can inform econometrics!
- Random Forest, Network Graph theory, nonparametric approaches
- Neural Networks

## Slide 49: Terminology - an aside econometrics vs ML

- Dependent Variable ( Y)  ~  predictor and predicted values
- Independent Variable ( X)   ~ regressors, explanatory variables     ~ coefficients, betas
- X  in the ML world might be called “model features”
- Y in the ML world might be called “target”
- 0-1 variables when  they are in the Y variable - call for a different class of models- especially Logit model - in ML this would be a classifier model
- 0-1 dummy variables - in the X variable would be  called “one hot encoding” of categorical variables
- ML - split up your datasetTraining data - used for training the modelTesting data - used for measuring the accuracy of your model

- Market Makers and Dark Pools
- Huge unregulated pools of trades, within hedge funds, off markets
- Aggregated across users
- Spread between buy and sell

## Slide 22: How do we think about interest rates?

- Government Finance - a macroeconomic variable that can be used for policy
- Government setting interest rates to stimulate/slow economic growth
- But - interest rates are also set in the market place - and reflect decisions
- Time preference - how much would you be indifferent to having $ now vs money in the future  - discounting the future
- 5 % interest - $100 today would be worth $105 in  one year
- We can think about this in terms of a Loan  - cost to borrow
- Savings - payment for savings
- But it can be embedded in a whole range of financial arrangements

## Slide 23: Money has time value

- Would you rather have $100 now or later?
- Interest Rate, r
  - 5% interest rate => r= 0.05
- A deposit of $100 at bank 1 has a future value of $110.25 in 2 years.

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Continuous compounding -> the more frequent you compound the greater this interest accumulates

</details>

## Slide 24: Making a formula

- n= Number of times per year
- T = year
- Nt = number of times in a given that interest is paid
- How frequency you compound the greater the interest rate
- ( the faster it grows)

## Slide 25: Time Value of Money

- Future Value
- Present Value
- Discount Factor
- Present Value of an asset is the future value of the asset times a discount factor

## Slide 26: How does this play out as a consumer?

- Mortgage payment n=360 r=.03
- Student Loans n=120 r=.025
- Car Loans n=60  r=.04
- Credit Cards  n=??  r=.16
- A = Amortized Payment
- P=Principal
- r=interest rate as a decimal
- n= number of time periods

## Slide 27: Present Value and the value of a Bond

- F = face value
- iF = contractual interest rate
- C = F \* iF = coupon payment (periodic interest payment)
- N = number of payments
- i = market interest rate, or required yield, or observed / appropriate yield to maturity (see below)
- M = value at maturity, usually equals face value
- P = market price of bond.

## Slide 28: There are many types of bonds

- Treasury Bonds
- Savings Bonds
- Agency Bonds
- Municipal Bonds
- Corporate Bonds

## Slide 40: Personal Finance: Stock/Bond Split

## Slide 41: Personal Finance: Stock/Bond Split

## Slide 42: Personal Finance: Portfolio Allocation

- You’ve figured out your stock/bond split, but what stocks should you buy? Financial advisors generally suggest a well-diversified set of stocks, which can be easily achieved through ETFs, index funds, or mutual funds. But which ones?
- Pay attention to:
- Diversification

## Slide 55: Long and Short

- Finance jargons explained:
- Long ≈ Buy
- Short ≈ Sell
- So,
- Long a stock means buy a stock
- Short a stock means sell a stock

## Slide 56: More about Short

- But shorting a stock doesn’t mean you need to own the stock beforehand…

## Slide 57: More about Short

- But shorting a stock doesn’t mean you need to own the stock beforehand…
- Imagine if you think the stock price is going down tomorrow

## Slide 58: More about Short

- But shorting a stock doesn’t mean you need to own the stock beforehand…
- Imagine if you think the stock price is going down tomorrow
- Now (Stock price = $100): Borrow a share from a broker - sell it  - get $100
- Tomorrow (Stock price = $70):If stock goes down over a year $70 - buy it back for $70
- Give the share back to the broker  Made $100 - $70 = $30
- “Short”  - borrow/sell now ~ later buy/give back
- ( and you have to pay some interest on borrowing that stock for 1 year)
- ( and how much collateral do you have to put down)

## Slide 59: More about Short

- But shorting a stock doesn’t mean you need to own the stock beforehand…
- Imagine if you think the stock price is going down tomorrow
- Now (Stock price = $100): Borrow a share from a broker - sell it  - get $100
- Tomorrow (Stock price = $70):If stock goes down over a year $70 - buy it back for $70
- Give the share back to the broker  Made $100 - $70 = $30
- “Short”  - borrow/sell now ~ later buy/give back
- ( and you have to pay some interest on borrowing that stock for 1 year)
- ( and how much collateral do you have to put down)
- You are shorting $100 of this stock at this moment

## Slide 60: Stocks Options

- Stocks: Ownership in the company
- Price: The price of the stock was last traded for
- Long Position: The party that has agreed to buy the underlying in the future
- Short Position: The party that has agreed to sell the underlying stock in the future

## Slide 61: Futures

- The 125th Big Game is around the corner (Nov 19th)! You want to buy a ticket from a “certified” reseller, but you will only have enough cash to pay for a ticket next week. The reseller told you that the ticket price is very volatile.

## Slide 62: Futures

- How to secure a ticket from the reseller?
- The reseller told you that you can “book” a ticket at $110. So you will have to buy a ticket at $110 on Nov. 15th regardless of the market price at the time.

## Slide 63: Futures

- How to secure a ticket from the reseller?
- The reseller told you that you can “book” a ticket at $110. So you will have to buy a ticket at $110 on Nov. 15th regardless of the market price at the time.
- This is called a future contract.
- Futures are a type of derivative contract agreement to buy or sell a specific commodity asset or security at a set future date for a set price.

## Slide 64: Futures

- Would you enter into this future contract at $110 for a Big Game ticket?

## Slide 65: Futures

- Would you enter into this future contract at $110 for a Big Game ticket?
- The market price on Nov 15th turns out to be $80

## Slide 66: Futures - Payoff Diagram

- For those who entered the future contract:
- You buy the ticket at $110 when the market price is $80
- market price
- profit/loss
- 110
- 140
- 80
- -30
- 30

## Slide 67: Futures - Payoff Diagram

- What if the price on Nov 15th is $140?
- market price
- profit/loss
- 110
- 140
- 80
- -30
- 30

## Slide 68: Futures - Payoff Diagram

- What if the price on Nov 15th is $120?
- market price
- profit/loss
- 110
- 140
- 80
- -30
- 30

## Slide 69: Futures - Payoff Diagram

- So the payoff diagram is the following:
- market price
- profit/loss
- 110
- 140
- 80
- -30
- 30

## Slide 70: Option

- What if we want to make sure that the price doesn’t go more than $110, but also want to have the freedom to buy tickets if the actual market price is lower?
- market price
- profit/loss
- 110
- 140
- 80
- -30
- 30

## Slide 71: Call Options

- Call: Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation to buy the underlying stock in the future at a pre-specified price, and this pre-specified price is called the strike price.
- Strike price = $100

## Slide 72: Call Options

- When you buy a call (you are longing a call) with strike price $100,
- If the stock price is $150, you can exercise your call and buy the stock at $100

## Slide 73: Call Options

- When you buy a call (you are in a long call position) with strike price $100,
- If the stock price is $150, you can exercise your call and buy the stock at $100
- If the stock price is $100, you can buy the stock at $100
- If the stock price is $50, you can buy the stock at $50
- Call option is an option rather than a binding contract!

## Slide 74: Call Options

- When you buy a call (you are in a long call position) with strike price $100,
- If the stock price is $150, you can exercise your call and buy the stock at $100
- If the stock price is $100, you can buy the stock at $100
- If the stock price is $50, you can buy the stock at $50
- Call option is an option rather than a binding contract!
- Quick check: you would buy a call (long call) if you think the stock price is going up or going down?

## Slide 75: Call Options

- When you buy a call (you are in a long call position) with strike price $100,
- If the stock price is $150, you can exercise your call and buy the stock at $100
- If the stock price is $100, you can buy the stock at $100
- If the stock price is $50, you can buy the stock at $50
- Call option is an option rather than a binding contract!
- Sanity check: you would buy a call (long call) if you think the stock price is going up or going down?
- Going up!

## Slide 76: Call Options

- You can think about call options as an “insurance”.
- It insures that you don’t need to pay more than the strike price for a stock.

## Slide 77: Calls

- Insurance for people who are short some stock, but this isn’t the most helpful way to think about them.
- Suppose you want to buy and hold a stock, but you aren’t sure if the value of the stock will go up in a desired time frame. Instead of buying the stock and risking that its value will decrease, you could buy a call that gives you the opportunity to purchase the stock at some price that you want, say $100. That way, if the value of the stock goes above $100, instead of missing out on that increase in value, your call gives you the right to purchase the stock at $100, even though it is actually worth more than $100. If the stock is worth less than $100 after some time, you don’t have to do anything and you didn’t lose the value you would have lost if you had purchased the stock.

## Slide 82: Put Options

- Put: Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying stock in the future at a pre-specified price, and this pre-specified price is called the strike price.

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Diagrams are wrong!

</details>

## Slide 83: Put Options

- You can think about put options as an “insurance”.
- It insures that you won’t sell less than the strike price for a stock.

## Slide 84: Put Options

- You want your stock to be able to increase in value over time, but you also don’t want its value to decrease too much.
- One way to achieve this is to buy “insurance” on your stock. You might want an insurance contract that will cover losses if the value of your stock goes below a certain number.
- A Contract that pays you a dollar for each dollar that your stock does below some specified number.

## Slide 85: Put Options

## Slide 89: Put example

- So for instance, if you own a stock that trades at $110, and you don’t want to lose more than $10 in value from owning the stock, you might buy a put with a strike of $100.
- The strike of the put is this pre-specified number below which you don’t want to lose money.
- Now, let’s say your stock starts going down in value. Going down from $110 to $100, there’s nothing that your put can do.
- But starting at $100, each dollar that your stock goes down in value, your put pays you one dollar. Therefore, when you own this put in combination with the stock, the overall value of this combination cannot go below $100.

## Slide 90: Analogy with Car Insurance and Put/Call

- Understand the loss for Long and Short Position
- Let’s say that you cannot risk losing more than $10 while trading. There you want to be insured against the risk involved with holding a long/short position
- Therefore, we will opt for an ‘insurance’ for our stock position!
- Think about this in terms of Car Insurance and the associated deductibles
- In this example, since you don’t want to lose more than $10, our ‘deductible’ = $10 and we bought the stock for $100
- For each dollar below $90 you lose a $1 but also the insurance company pays you $1, so you are even beyond that point.

## Slide 91: Put Options

- Put: Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation to sell (100 shares) the underlying stock in the future at a pre-specified price ( strike price)
- 100-110 = Deductible
- Insurance - payoff for below 100

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Diagrams are wrong!

</details>

## Slide 92: Puts and Calls - are just contracts

- Notice that all of this occurred without you ever owning the stock to begin with.
- These are just types of contracts - that get made into financial contracts that can be bought and sold

## Slide 93: Hedging - combine into a portfolio

- How do options hedge us against loss?
- Example: Put
- +
- =
- Different Y axis!

## Slide 94: Option Pricing  - we can look at data in Lecture Notebook

- Options have premiums
- Premiums compensate for the person bearing a risk to provide the ‘insurance’
- Example: Call (Gives the holder the right to buy the underlying stock in the future at a pre-specified price)
- Factors that determine the price of options:
- Strike Price: The lower the strike price, the more I am going to charge
- Time until Expiration: Longer the time period, the more I am going to charge
- Volatility: If a stocks moves a lot, the more I am going to charge
- Underlying Stock Price: The higher the price of underlying stock, the more I am going to charge

## Slide 95: Black Scholes

- Don’t get intimidated we won’t derive it
- It take the four factors
- 𝑆  is the price of the stock,
- 𝐾 is the strike of the call,
- 𝑟 is the risk-free interest rate,
- 𝑇 is time till expiration,
- 𝑁() is the normal CDF, which measures of variability

## Slide 96: Returns

- The return on a security has two components:
- The change in price of the security
- Any cash flows associated with the security (dividends for stock, coupons for bonds)
- Rate of return (r) for change in price over a time interval     as

## Slide 97: In the Lecture Notebook

- Download data for SPY and Nasdaq
- Calculate returns
- Need to know ticker symbol and date range
- Pandas - calculate returns from difference from last time period
- In the homework
- Download Data for other stocks

## Slide 98: Graphs for Returns

- Time Series graph of S&P 500                       Graph for S&P 500 Returns

- What are environmental amenities?
- Clean air, water, and stable temperatures
- Healthy soil, forests, and oceans
- Also parks, rivers, mountains, beaches!
- What do you notice about these?
- Non-rivalrous (ish): use does not reduce the amount available for others.
- Non-excludable (ish): use does not exclude a certain person or group of persons from consumption.
- What are these also known as?
  - Public goods!
- Central to Environmental Economics models:
- Usage of these go unaccounted for in the current market models.

## Slide 19: Trends: The Environmental Kuznets Curve Theory

- Theory:
- Economic development and environmental degradation have a downward-facing U-shape relationship.
- For example:
- Pollution, water quality, deforestation
- In our demo, we will be checking the path over different stages of
- economic development in 15 nations!

## Slide 20: Class question

## Slide 39: MAC: Dynamic vs. Static Costs Assessment

- The McKinsey MAC considers only static costs!
- Static Costs:
- The fixed costs of a new intervention, unchanged over a lifetime of an investment.
- Dynamic Costs:
- Cost considering potential cost-reduction from increased efficiency, learning-by-doing, and other positive spillovers.

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

You can examine the technology deployment and reductions in annual emissions at a single marginal abatement cost, such as $0 per ton, or in a range of costs, such as $0 to $60 per ton.

From the report: “explicitly incorporating path- dependent, cross-sector interactions, the diminishing returns of marginal measures, and considering measures that become cost-effective when other measures are deployed at scale.”

</details>

## Slide 45: Conclusion Part II

- We asked: What are the most cost-effective ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions?
- We answered this by sorting it by marginal abatement costs (the cost of reducing the next ton of CO2 / Methane).
- We observed that the cost of the carbon matters (a lot!).
- Now we need to ask ourselves: How can we use economic policy & theory to drive this reduction? To do so, we need to construct a cost of carbon.

## Slide 46: Part III: 

			Policy: Introducing Emission Taxes vs. Cap-and-trade

- Part III:
- Policy: Introducing Emission Taxes vs. Cap-and-trade

## Slide 47: Class question

- Philosophical question:
- What’s your way of reducing something that is deemed bad?
- Economic answer:
- Taxes (You want to do something ‘bad’ - pay up!)
- Carbon Tax, Methane Tax, Alcohol Tax, Tax my Strada Coffee Cup?
- Quotas (You can only do ‘this much bad’)
- Cap and trade on carbon, methane, sulfuric dioxide

## Slide 48: Policy: Tax policy using MAC

- Set a tax
- Abate this
- Question: Who profits in this deal?

## Slide 49: Policy: C&T MAC curve

- Get a price
- Opportunities to trade?
- Set a cap
- Question: Who profits in this deal?

## Slide 50: Policy: How C&T works at firm-level

## Slide 51: Policy: Cap & Trade vs. Command-and-Control

- How to implement? How has this worked in the past? Connection to MAC?
- Marginal cost of abatement

## Slide 52: Policy: Carbon Tax vs. C&T Illustrated

- Amount of pollution
- Cost of Emission
- Regulator sets amount of emission permits
- Companies trade permits to get to efficient point
- Amount of pollution

## Slide 53: Policy: Global Coverage of Tax & Cap-and-Trade (ETS)

- Source: Carbon Pricing Dashboard (World Bank)

## Slide 54: Policy: Real world examples of Cap-and-Trade

## Slide 55: PM 2.5 Regulation - Nationally and in California

## Slide 56: Pm 2.5 violations - nationally

## Slide 57: Conclusion Part III

- We asked how we can reduce something bad - like pollution!
- We gave an economist answer (I’m sure there’s other ways of doing this) that taxes and/or cap&trade can work.
- We showed how we can intuitively predict / shape policy outcomes by using the MAC.
- Conclusion
- Overall, we’ve looked at historical emissions in time and space. We then looked at the most cost-effective ways of reducing them, and the policy tools we have to do so. This is only the tip of the iceberg of environmental economics, but I hope you’ve enjoyed this lecture!

- Motivate econometrics through a data science perspective

## Slide 8: Why Economics & Data Science?

- “If Economics continues to be the major it is now, and Data Science emerges as an alternative, a good chunk of people who are currently going into economics will realize that it makes much more sense to become a Data Science major, with a minor in economics - and I would say they’re making the right choice!”  - Steven Levitt
- “The Data Science tools may well turn out to be in the first half of the 2000s the equivalent of a fine chancery hand was in Oxford or Cambridge in the 1400s, just as a facility with the document formats and commands of the Microsoft office at the end of the 1900s: practical, general skills that make you of immense value to most if not nearly all organizations.”  - Brad DeLong
- “I think Econometrics could use a lot of the techniques that are common in Data Science, such as bootstrapping…techniques for data-driven procedures and there’s a lot of really creative ideas in terms of presenting data …”  - David Card
- “I write Jupyter Notebooks, I write Python, try my models out in Python, and it’s very empowering…I think the students at Berkeley are lucky..  The things you have now!  ”  - Thomas Sargent
- “During the pandemic, you could track comfort with social interactions using Open Table reservations. I don't have to tell you all how closely you can track rents in pricey Bay Area neighborhoods using tools like Zillow, Apartments.com, and Apartment List. These types of housing data inform the Federal Reserve's understanding of inflation. I am confident your generation will transform our capability to use high-frequency, real-time data, applying your unique perspectives to deepen our understanding of how our economy is evolving.” - Lisa Cook

- Let’s start with an example from a textbook
- An individual person’s demand
- Kms driven per semester

## Slide 6: Demand Slopes Down - Law of Demand

- Slopes down for 3 reasons:
- Decreasing Marginal Benefit   - Diminishing Marginal Utility
  - You don’t need that much of any one good!
- Substitution Effect
  - You can get utility from other goods
- Income Effect
  - A cheaper price leaves more money in your pocket to buy more

## Slide 7: Demand Slopes Down - Demand Schedule

- Decreasing Marginal Benefit
- Tanks of gas per semester
- First tank is worth a lot… last tank worth less
- https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/uvicecon103/chapter/3-2-building-demand-and-consumer-surplus/

## Slide 8: Demand Slopes Down

- Behind a smooth curve is a chunky staircase

## Slide 9: Demand Slopes Down

## Slide 10: 2) Income Effect

- If price goes down, you have more money left to spend!
- What do Canadians call their money?

## Slide 19: Elasticity

- Inelastic - price changes and quantity does not
- Medical necessity
- Steeper Curve
- Elastic - price changes and quantity moves more
- Lots of Substitutes
- Flatter Curve

## Slide 20: Types of Elasticity

- Price Elasticity of Demand (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in own Price)
- PED >1 - elastic
- demand is responsive to price - for a given change in P -> bigger change in Q
- PED<1 - inelastic
- demand is NOT responsive to price - for a given change in P -> smaller change in Q
- Income Elasticity of Demand
- (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income)
- Cross Price Elasticity of Demand
- (% Change in Quantity Demanded of Good A) / (% Change in Price of Good B)
- XED > 0 - Substitute
- Increase in price for Good B -> Increase in Demand for Good A
- XED < 0 - Complement
- Increase in price for Good B -> Decrease in Demand for Good A

- Chicken - Consumers perceive link between virus and poultry
  - In India, chicken prices have decreased by 70%
  - “People were avoiding consumption of meat, fish, chicken, and egg” -
- Economic Times of India
- Beef - Supply change interruption because meat packing factories are a covid hotspot
  - The retail price for beef in April was $6.22 per pound — 26 cents higher per pound than the month before (BLS)
  - At the same time, at the end of April, the average price for a steer was below $100 per hundred pounds; the five-year average for that same week was about $135 per hundred pounds
  - Unexpected price fluctuations → USDA investigation

## Slide 6: Confusion in Lab 1

- Which is the cause, which is the effect?
- Which is the X, which is the Y
- Qd = Q(P)
- Consumers take a price and decide how much to consume
- In Econ - we put Price on the Y axis, but think of it as the “X”
- Consumers / Firms - “take a price” and respond to it by setting quantity

## Slide 7: There’s 6 Lecture Notebooks	!  (Sorry)

- Supply - with Cubic function
- Supply - with fixed table
- California Energy
- CAISO - really hot Tuesday
- Symbolic Python

## Slide 8: Cost and Supply Curves

## Slide 9: Starting off in the Abstract- Cost Curves

- C(Q) - Cost function
- Total Costs of producing a Unit of Output
- Average Costs - C(Q) / Q
- Marginal Costs - Cost to produce an additional unit
  - MC = Δ TVC/ Δ Q
  - Or Equivalently  MC = Δ TC/ Δ Q

## Slide 10: Varian Chapter 21

## Slide 11: https://econvideos.ucsd.edu/video\_handbooks/Intermediate-Microeconomics-Video-Handbook/media/w22g3.html

## Slide 12: Fixed versus Variable - Short Run

- Variable Cost - inputs can be adjusted or changed in short run
  - AVC(Q) = C(Q)/Q
  - Labor, raw materials, etc.
- Fixed Costs - (capital, land) cannot be adjusted in the short run
  - cost of producing nothing
  - Overhead like machines, land, etc.

## Slide 13: Total Costs  - what shape is this and what is the “intuition”

- Quantity of Output
- C(Q)
- $

## Slide 14: Cost Curves

## Slide 26: Case Study - 2001 Energy Crisis

## Slide 27: Enron and the California blackout of 2001

- Private energy trading firm
- Hold production off market
- Idle plants
- Reduce transmission

## Slide 28: Energy Strategy Game - How does the game work

- Groups are in teams - that own a portfolio of plants
- Plants have different Variable costs and production capacities
- The day is divided into four time periods
- Teams look at a forecast for each time period and bid how much power they plan to supply
- Market clears at power supplied, and quantity demanded
- Market Price yields profits for each plant, and each portfolio

## Slide 29: Energy Game

- Today we are just looking at the Supply Curve
- Variable Costs per unit of electricity produced
- Start by ranking all producers ( plants ) by their variable  costs from low to high
- Graph with width of bar being quantity supplied in MW
- Profits = Price - VC
- Where price is determined by Market Demand vs Market Supply
- (This Energy grid is 20 years out of date)
  - No solar, no wind, no batteries

## Slide 13: 40 Bn CHIPS ACT Funding  - TMSC Arizona

## Slide 14: Fundamental Idea - simplify for a model

- A nation's output is a function of the amount of the factors of production that are utilized in its economy; that is to say output is a function of labor and capital, scaled by some value A.
- What could A be? Why is it on the outside of the production function?

## Slide 15: Economic Model

- Could this be for a firm?
- Compare across firms?
- Could this be for an entire country ?
- Compare across countries ?
- Could this be for a State?

## Slide 16: Total Factor Productivity (TFP)

- Technology or research and development
- A country with a high TFP can producer far more goods and services than another country with a lower TFP but the same amount of capital and labor
- Differences between TFP and other factors of production
  - “Scales” production by some factor A - creates proportional increase in output
  - Technology is non-rivalrous
  - Technology is non-excludable
  - Ordinal measure

## Slide 17: How the equation was formulated

- Based on the graphs to the right, what would F(K, L) look like?
- Image source: Hawkins’ 100B; Lecture 4, Slide 9

## Slide 18: Cobb Douglas Orginal Data Visualization - 1928

- https://assets.aeaweb.org/asset-server/journals/aer/top20/18.1.139-165.pdf
- Cobb, C. W.; Douglas, P. H. (1928). "A Theory of Production" . American Economic Review. 18(Supplement): 139–165. JSTOR 1811556. Retrieved 26 September 2016.

## Slide 19: Plotting the Model outcome vs Actual outcome

## Slide 20: Analyze the error rate of the model

## Slide 21: Cobb-Douglas Production Functions

- For simplicity sake, Cobb Douglas assume constant returns to scale. That is, alpha + beta = 1. This allows us to rewrite the function in the following way:
- Where else do we see this function?

## Slide 22: Lecture Notebook 1

## Slide 23: Lecture Notebook

## Slide 24: Capital

- A monetary value of the stock or value of all productive, physical assets in an economy (not bonds, stocks or other financial products)
- Increasing returns to capital
- At a decreasing rate
- Fix A, L, alpha
- Vary K

## Slide 25: Behind the textbook

## Slide 26: (untitled)

- Beta = none?
- np.arange(x,y,z)

## Slide 27: MPK

- Diminishing marginal returns to capital
- What is the intuition behind this?

## Slide 28: Labor

- The number of hours worked by all individuals who are willing and able to work within a country for a given year
- Increasing Returns to Scale

## Slide 29: Marginal Product of Labor

- Diminishing Marginal Returns to Labor
- What is the intuition behind this?

## Slide 30: Cross-Country Comparisons

- Cobb and Douglas found that a country’s output can be modeled very well as a weighted average of the log of capital and labor.
- How can we rearrange the function to only be in terms of one variable?

## Slide 31: Cross-Country Comparisons (cont.)

- How can we use the above function to compare countries?

## Slide 32: Shifts in A

- Supply or Technology shocks
  - Natural environment
  - Energy prices
  - Significant financial crises
- What would happen to output?

## Slide 33: What does alpha mean?

- Output elasticities of capital and labor: measure the responsiveness of output to a change in the levels of either labor or capital, holding all else constant.
- Let us assume constant returns to scale. What does alpha > 0.5 mean?

## Slide 34: Returns to scale

- Constant Returns to Scale: alpha + beta = 1
- Decreasing Returns to Scale: alpha + beta < 1
- Increasing Returns to Scale: alpha + beta > 1
- What would the last two look like?

## Slide 37: Penn World Tables

- https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en

## Slide 38: Penn World Tables in the Economist

- Another tension in China’s push for self-reliance concerns productivity. Total factor productivity (ie, the amount of output per unit of labour and capital) has barely grown under Mr Xi, a marked deceleration from before the financial crisis (see chart 6). The government believes that aiming for self-sufficiency in high-tech industries will encourage innovation and so boost productivity. In fact, the opposite is more likely. In its efforts to boost domestic champions and spur trade with friendly countries, the government will probably end up conferring advantages on firms that are not the most efficient or capable suppliers of a given product, thereby denting productivity. Because lifting productivity is the only lasting way to raise living standards, that is a worrying prospect.

## Slide 5: Lecture 5 Outline - Consumer Choice

- What is Utility?
- Properties of Utility
- Utility Functions
- Consumption Bundles
- Indifference Curves
- Budget Constraints
- Constrained Utility Maximization
- Demand Curves
- QuantEcon Notebook
- What is Latex? What is Markdown?

## Slide 6: What is Utility?

- Abstract and hard to measure
- “Measure of Satisfaction, Worth, Value”
- Units to measure utility??
- Utility is a method to model how individuals make decisions
- A starting point for math to model economic choices

## Slide 7: Properties of Utility

- Ordinal: ordering matters, but the numerical value in and of itself does not
  - E.g. we prefer something with 3 utility units over 2 utility units, but 3 utility units in and of itself does not have any meaning!
  - Utility only has meaning relative to other goods
- “Consumers are rational”
  - They try to maximize their utility
- Our utility is dependent on the goods we consume, and they may affect each other
  - Consumption of left and right shoes
  - Consumption of doughnuts and croissants
- Transitivity: If A is preferred to B, and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to C.

## Slide 8: Properties of Utility

- Non-negative marginal utility: More is better
- Decreasing marginal utility

## Slide 9: Calculus

- First Derivative is positive - increasing utility
- Second Derivative is negative  - at a decreasing rate
- Math Models - what functions work ?

## Slide 10: Utility with 1 Good

- X: quantity of goods consumed
- Y: utility
- Does this satisfy our 2 properties?
- Non-negative marginal utility
- Decreasing marginal utility
- Increasing at a decreasing rate

## Slide 11: Utility Functions

- Utility functions consider many goods at a time:
- Ideally, when modeling a consumer’s utility we would like to consider all the goods in the world, since relationships may exist between any combination of them. But this is infeasible :(
- Instead, we simplify the world to assume that consumers only seek to maximize their utility between 2 goods.
- A ‘basket’ of goods that the consumer chooses to purchase
- We will simplify our choice set into quantities of each of 2 goods

## Slide 12: Cobb Douglas Utility Function

- Does it satisfy our 2 properties?
- Non-negative marginal utility
- Decreasing marginal utility for both good 1 (x1) and good 2 (x2)

## Slide 13: Consumption Bundles

- A ‘basket’ of goods that the consumer chooses to purchase
- We will vastly simplify our choice set into only 2 goods
- X\_1 = 2
- X\_2 = 3

## Slide 14: Each point represents a consumption bundle

- x\_1=10, x\_2=15
- Coffee
- Doughnuts

## Slide 15: Indifference Curves

- Each axis represents the quantity of a good we consume
- 2 axis = 2 goods
- Indifference curve: a line on the graph that yields the same utility.

## Slide 16: Different Indifference Curves

- A
- B
- C
- Which consumption bundle do consumers prefer the most?

## Slide 17: Different Indifference Curves

- A
- B
- C
- Bundle B is preferred to A (B offers a higher utility than A)
- Bundle C is indifferent to B (they yield the same utility)
- Thus, Bundle C is preferred to A

## Slide 18: Different Indifference Curves - Outwards is better

- A
- B
- C

## Slide 19: Indifference Curves Cannot Cross

- A
- B
- C
- D

## Slide 20: PollEV

## Slide 21: Indifference Curves Cannot Cross

- A
- B
- C
- D is preferred to A
- B is thus preferred to A
- C is preferred to B,
- but A is indifferent to C
- => This violates transitivity!
- D

## Slide 22: Indifference Curves are like Contour Maps

## Slide 23: Budget Constraints

- If consumers had no budget constraints, then they would always pick the infinitely rightmost curve.
- Income
- Price of good 1
- Quantity of good 1
- Price of good 2
- Quantity of good 2
- We will assume that consumers spend every cent they have to maximize utility.

## Slide 24: Graphing the Budget Constraint

- Donuts
- Coffee
- (M/p\_1,0)
- (0, M/p\_2 )
- Spend all your money on coffee
- What we can afford
- Spend all your money on donuts

## Slide 25: Graphing the Budget Constraint

- Donuts
- Coffee
- Less income
- More income

## Slide 26: Properties of Budget Constraints

- For any given income level, the possible points to satisfy the budget constraint forms a line.
- Slope: negative ratio of 2 prices (write x\_2 in terms of x\_1)
- Intercepts: when only 1 good is consumed.

## Slide 27: An Example

- M = $5
- P\_coffee = $2    All coffee = 2.5
- P\_donuts = $1     All donuts = 5
- Donuts
- Coffee
- (2, 1.5) also on budget constraint: 2\*1 + 1.5\*2 = 5

## Slide 28: What if...

- Income doubles (M = $10)?
- Price of coffee increases to $2.5?
- Price of donuts increases to $2?
- How does the slope and intercepts change in each of these scenarios?

## Slide 29: 1)  Income Doubles (Y=10)

- 1)  Income Doubles (Y=10)
- 2)  Price of Coffee increases (Pc=2.5)
- 3)  Price of Donuts increases(Pd=2)
- Donuts
- Coffee

## Slide 30: Constrained Utility Maximization

- Consumers will choose the bundle that gives them the highest utility that they can afford.

## Slide 31: Which Bundle Will Consumers Pick?

- B
- A
- C

## Slide 32: Which Bundle Will Consumers Pick?

- B
- A
- C
- Bundles
- A and B - can afford
- C - cannot afford
- Utilities
- C > B > A

## Slide 33: Which Bundle Will Consumers Pick?

- B
- A
- C
- Consumer will choose where the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint
- No point on the higher curve is affordable
- All points on lower curve are inferior

## Slide 34: Demand Curves

- Change in price of a good: doughnuts
- Hold price of Good 2 constant (coffee)
- Hold M constant (income)
- Vary price of Good 1 (doughnuts)

## Slide 35: Red = price of doughnuts = 2$
Blue = price of doughnuts= 1.5$
Green = price of doughnuts = 1$

- Red = price of doughnuts = 2$
- Blue = price of doughnuts= 1.5$
- Green = price of doughnuts = 1$
- Donuts
- Coffee

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

If Y is 5$ and Price of coffee is 2$/cup  - you will always be able to buy 2.5 cups of coffee
Red = price of good 2 = 2$
Blue = price of good 2= 1.5$
Green = price of good 2= 1$

</details>

## Slide 36: (untitled)

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

For each of these budget lines -
we can find the point of tangency 
and see how much is consumed - find the quantity that corresponds to each price

</details>

## Slide 37: A Demand Curve is Born

## Slide 38: Demand Shocks and Shifts

- Hold prices of both goods to be constant
- Income increases: budget constraint shifts, allowing us to reach a higher level of utility

## Slide 39: Y= Income increases

- Y= Income increases

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Lets look at a change in Income
The budget line shifts out in a parallel slope
We get to a higher indifference curve  ( more money we are happier)
So the quantity of good 2 demanded increases from 1.2 to 1.5

- Open source, shareable, and cross platform software
- We think it’s a good thing for you to know about
- Economists use it
- Economics grad students use it
- Upper Div CS classes use it

## Slide 52: There are easier approaches - hostmath.com

## Slide 53: Let’s go make an overleaf account
https://www.overleaf.com/

“Sign in with Google”
Use UC Berkeley Account

## Slide 54: Overleaf - start a new file

- Copy and paste text into new document on Overleaf
- Or… download file and upload to Overleaf
- You can upload a template
- You can import other folks files
- You can do all of the formatting of the file
- Sections, Headers, Tables
- Journal Article templates
- Quiz and Homework templates

## Slide 55: Good things to know about LaTeX

- Language uses \ a lot to denote actions or unique characters
- Everything that’s part of a symbol or function is wrapped within {}
- E.g. \frac{5}{8} == ⅝
- E.g. \section{This is a section header}

## Slide 56: Titles and Imports

- TLDR: don’t worry about these

## Slide 57: Sections and Subsections

- \section{<SECTION NAME>}
- Without numbers: \section\*{<SECTION NAME>}

## Slide 58: Making a List

- \graphicspath{ {./images/} }
- To add an image:
- Make sure an images folder is created, then to include image.png:
- \includegraphics{image.png}

## Slide 60: Typesetting Equations

- In-line: $<LATEX FORMULA>$
- As its own block: there are a few ways to do this. Two of my most commonly used:
- $$<LATEX FORMULA>$$
- \begin{align\*}<LHS> &<OP> <RHS> \\etc.
- \end{align\*}

## Slide 61: Formulas

- Let’s do four examples:
- The quadratic formula
- Partial Derivative:
- Integral: 			(Does this seem familiar?)
- Simplify 		 	   in 2 steps using align

## Slide 62: You can paste this into Jupyter

- For standalone formulas:

## Slide 13: Lorenz Curve

- Rank every person in order by how much income
- ( rank each bin of the population - eg decile = 10%)
- X axis - income percentile
- Y axis -  at the Xth percentile, share of combined income for everyone below the Xth percentile
- For any point (x,y) on the Lorenz curve, we can say that “the bottom x percent own y% of the income”.

## Slide 18: Conditions of the Lorenz Curve

- (0,0) and (1,1) on the curve
  - (0,0): 0% of the households own 0% of the total income
  - (1,1): 100% of the households own 100% of the total income
- Slope is always increasing (convex function, second derivative > 0)
  - X-axis is based on income percentile, which sorts households in ascending order of income
  - E.g. the household at the 1st percentile will earn less than the household at the 2nd percentile. Hence, the change in total income % at the 2nd percentile must be greater than the change in total income at the 1st percentile
  - We can apply this logic to every percentile!

## Slide 19: Line of Perfect Equality

- What would the Lorenz curve look like if our economy was perfectly equal?
- Hint: everyone has the same income!

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

</details>

## Slide 20: Line of Perfect Equality

- Since everyone has the same income:
- 1st percentile & under owns 1% of income
- 2nd percentile & under owns 2% of income
- …
- 100th percentile & under owns 100% of income

## Slide 26: Which country has more inequality? (II)

## Slide 27: Motivation for the Gini Coefficient

- The previous example highlights an ambiguity with directly using the Lorenz Curve as a measure of income inequality.
- To address this, we turn to the Gini Coefficient

## Slide 28: Gini Coefficient

## Slide 29: Gini Coefficient - Using Calculus

## Slide 30: Gini Coefficient - Using Calculus

- In the homework, you will empirically apply a Lorenz curve function to different countries, and use that to compute the Gini coefficient!

## Slide 31: Gini Coefficient - Intuition

- What is the Gini coefficient if the economy is perfectly equal?
- What is the Gini coefficient if the economy is completely unequal?

## Slide 32: Gini Coefficient - Intuition

- What is the Gini coefficient if the economy is perfectly equal?
- Since Lorenz curve = Line of equality, A = 0. Hence, Gini = 0.
- What is the Gini coefficient if the economy is completely unequal?
- We can imagine that complete inequality entails 1 person owning all the income. Hence, The area of B is minimized to be essentially 0. Hence, Gini = 1.

## Slide 37: Summary of the Gini index

- The Gini coefficient is a good measure for the magnitude of income inequality, allowing us to easily compare income inequality across countries.
- Typically, Gini coefficients range between 0.25 and 0.5
- Computing the Gini coefficient is quite complicated: comprehensive income data may not always be collected
- What about wealth inequality?

## Slide 64: Population Growth and Inequality Discussion

- How does population growth affect economic inequality?
- Growth Phase ( 20th Century)
- Strong correlation between a country’s population growth (measured by birth rates) and its income inequality
  - University of Toronto’s Marijn Bolhuis and University of Oxford’s Alexandra de Pleijt
- Wealth Phase ( 21st Century)
- Finds that low birth rates, rather than high birth rates, are causing today’s income inequality.
  - With lower birth rates, fewer children per couple are being borne, so these children get more of their parents’ inheritance.
  - Thomas Piketty (Economics Professor at  London School of Economics)

Federal Funds Rate -  NEED TO REDO

</details>

## Slide 14: Federal Funds Rate

- Two intuitive ways to think about interest rates
- -    Represent the cost of borrowing
- Can also be thought of as the opportunity cost of holding cash
- Adjusting the target FFR is one of the main ways that central banks enact monetary policy. We’ll touch more on this later
- Go down to “heat up” the economy, and go up to “cool it off”
- This is what’s known as expansionary vs contractionary monetary policy
- Fisher equation: real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation

## Slide 15: How interest rates affects output, unemployment and inflation

- Federal Funds Rate (FFR)
- What happens to investment if the FFR decreases? Think cost of borrowing
- What happens to savings if the FFR decreases?
- How do we expect output to change if the FFR decreases?
- Recall our formula for GDP Y=C+I+G+NX

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Ask the audience the last question, if no one answers then proceed by answering it myself, 

GDP Y=C+I+G+NX (If rates decrease, then C and I go up)
Consumption - save less money because of lower rates
Net Exports (NX):
Currency Value: Lower interest rates generally lead to a depreciation of the local currency because lower rates decrease the returns on assets denominated in that currency, making it less attractive to foreign investors. A weaker currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, potentially increasing net exports.
Competitiveness: As the local currency depreciates, domestic goods and services become cheaper for foreigners, boosting exports. Conversely, foreign goods become more expensive for domestic consumers, potentially reducing imports.

</details>

## Slide 16: How interest rates affect output, unemployment and inflation

- What happens to investment if the FFR decreases? Increases!
- What happens to saving if the FFR decreases? Decreases!
- How do we expect output to change if the FFR decreases? Increases!
- Without any external events (ceteris paribus):
- Fed decreases FFR → real interest rate r decreases (Fisher equation)
- → Investment increases and savings decrease (it becomes cheaper to borrow and less attractive to save)
- → Output inputs and unemployment decreases (investment sparks production, creating jobs)
- → Wage inflation increases (firms must raise wages to attract workers in a competitive labour market) → Inflation increases
- TLDR: ↓r → ↑ Y → ↓u →↑𝜋

## Slide 20: We see these indicators all over the news today!

## Slide 21: Terms you might hear in the news

- Hawks vs Doves:
- Hawks favor high interest rates to keep inflation under control
- Doves worry that high rates can induce a recession. They want to keep rates low to encourage spending in the economy
- Paul Volcker: He was the Fed Chair from 1979-1987. He is a Hawk and famous for hiking interest rates in the 80s, and also being really tall. People draw comparisons between him and Jay Powell as of late
- Pivot: When the Fed shifts its monetary policy from contractionary to expansionary and vice versa
- Soft Landing: A gradual decline in production and activity that avoids triggering a recession. This is the Federal Reserve’s goal!
- Hard Landing: Think airplane. Occurs when there is a sudden harsh decline in growth and production. There is worry that we are headed towards one

## Slide 36: Phillips Curve

- Phillips Curve describes the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment: Inflation is higher when unemployment is low and lower when unemployment is high.
- where      is the inflation rate,                    is
- the unemployment gap.
- The original curve drawn for pre-WW1 data (1851-1913) by A.W. Phillips

## Slide 37: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- In the labor market, firms demand for labor, and workers supply labor. What will happen if demand for labor increases? Will firms pay more in order to hire new workers?

## Slide 38: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- In the labor market, firms demand for labor, and workers supply labor. What will happen if demand for labor increases? Will firms pay more in order to hire new workers?

## Slide 39: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- When the demand for labor increases, the pool of unemployed workers subsequently decreases and companies increase wages to compete and attract a smaller talent pool. The cost of wages increases and companies pass along those costs to consumers in the form of price increases. Thus, a lower unemployment rate ultimately translates to a higher inflation.

## Slide 40: Phillips Curve

- Think about the opposite direction.
- What will happen if the demand of labor decreases? Will the equilibrium wages increase or decrease? How will this affect the price of goods?

## Slide 48: Phillips Curve

- Many call this the “flattening of the Phillips Curve”.

## Slide 49: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- What economists initially failed to realize in constructing the Phillips curve was that people and firms take the expected level of inflation into account when deciding how much to produce and how much to consume. When workers expect prices to rise, they demand higher wages. When firms expect costs to rise, they set higher prices.
- where      is the inflation rate,         is the expected inflation rate,                  is the unemployment gap.

## Slide 50: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- Intuitions:
- Current the inflation rate is 3.7% (CPI, Oct 2023).
- When making labor contracts, would you take into account this expected rising living cost and demand higher wages?
- When making investments, would you take into account this expected inflation and demand higher nominal returns (for example, demand higher nominal interest rate for deposits)?

## Slide 51: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- How will this impact policy to combat inflation?
- To control inflation, we need to “anchor” people’s inflation expectation first.

## Slide 52: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- How does this hold in reality?

## Slide 78: The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. […] The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. 

Federal Open Market Committee, 11/5/20

- The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.

## Slide 79: What tools aside from changing the FFR does the Fed have to combat an economic downturn?

## Slide 80: Quantitative Easing (QE)

- “In addition, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.”

## Slide 81: What is QE?

- Goal: Increase the money supply and provide banks with liquidity, allowing them to increase lending, while decreasing risk (lower risk premia) and uncertainty in the market

## Slide 82: Forward Guidance

- “The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.“
- Federal Open Market Committee, 11/5/20
- Lower expected future short rates → lower current long rates (long rates are average of expected future short rates) → cheaper credit → higher spending

## Slide 83: Fiscal Policy

- Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
- Multiplier Effect: The total change in output is greater than the initial change because of further rounds of spending
- Automatic stabilizers = Social Welfare Net
- Unemployment insurance, social security payments

## Slide 84: Terms you might hear in the news

- Hawks vs Doves:
- Hawks favor high interest rates to keep inflation under control
- Doves worry that high rates can induce a recession. They want to keep rates low to encourage spending in the economy
- Paul Volcker: He was the Fed Chair from 1979-1987. He is a Hawk and famous for hiking interest rates in the 80s, and also being really tall. People draw comparisons between him and Jay Powell as of late
- Pivot: When the Fed shifts its monetary policy from contractionary to expansionary and vice versa
- Soft Landing: A gradual decline in production and activity that avoids triggering a recession. This is the Federal Reserve’s goal!
- Hard Landing: Think airplane. Occurs when there is a sudden harsh decline in growth and production. There is potential worry that we could be headed towards one if rate hikes go on for too long

## Slide 85: Topics we didn’t get to cover but wish we could’ve!

- Unconventional monetary policy
- Quantitative easing
- Forward guidance
- Fiscal Policy
- The 2008 Great Recession

- Lots of great articles and daily briefings straight to your inbox
- Here is a schedule of FOMC meetings and press releases.
- Finance journalist John Authers has a really cool newsletter that you can subscribe to for free. He writes about markets, inflation trends, the Federal Reserve and lots of other important news in the macro world.
- If you’re interested in what’s going on beyond the United States, Money Talks from The Economist is a great podcast to stay updated on macro news at the international level.

## Slide 87: How to use the FRED API

- The mystery graphs we showed at the beginning can be easily reproduced on the FRED website
- If we want to do more complex data analysis, we could download CSVs, but there’s also a way to set up an API so that you can retrieve the most up to date data in real time.

## Slide 6: Inflation

- Inflation measures how much prices change over time
- Typically captured by the CPI (Consumer Price Index), which looks at a fixed basket of the same goods and sees how they go up or down relative to a base year.
- Other indices include the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) or Fisher Price Index
- Does anybody know what inflation is today?
- In 1980, inflation was approximately 14.5%
- In 2000, inflation hovered around 3.5%

- Unemployment hit a record high during the heart of the coronavirus pandemic
- Data is collected by the Bureau of Labour Statistics
- On the first Friday of every month, the BLS releases employment statistics
- It has huuuuge impacts on bond markets, inflationary pressures, and GDP forecasts
- Surprise effect is what it is important!

Federal Funds Rate

</details>

## Slide 14: Federal Funds Rate

- Two intuitive ways to think about interest rates
- -    Represent the cost of borrowing
- Can also be thought of as the opportunity cost of holding cash
- Adjusting the target FFR is one of the main ways that central banks enact monetary policy. We’ll touch more on this later
- Go down to “heat up” the economy, and go up to “cool it off”
- This is what’s known as expansionary vs contractionary monetary policy
- Fisher equation:  real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation

## Slide 15: How interest rates affects output, unemployment and inflation

- Federal Funds Rate (FFR)
- What happens to investment if the FFR decreases? Think cost of borrowing
- What happens to savings if the FFR decreases?
- How do we expect output to change if the FFR decreases?
- Recall our formula for GDP Y=C+I+G+NX

## Slide 16: How interest rates affect output, unemployment and inflation

- What happens to investment if the FFR decreases? Increases!
- What happens to saving if the FFR decreases? Decreases!
- How do we expect output to change if the FFR decreases? Increases!
- Without any external events (ceteris paribus):
- Fed decreases FFR → real interest rate r decreases (Fisher equation)
- → Investment increases and savings decrease (it becomes cheaper to borrow and less attractive to save)
- → Output inputs and unemployment decreases (investment sparks production, creating jobs)
- → Wage inflation increases (firms must raise wages to attract workers in a competitive labour market) → Inflation increases
- TLDR: ↓r → ↑ Y → ↓u →↑𝜋

- the unemployment gap.
- The original curve drawn for pre-WW1 data (1851-1913) by A.W. Phillips

## Slide 37: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- In the labor market, firms demand for labor, and workers supply labor. What will happen if demand for labor increases? Will firms pay more in order to hire new workers?

## Slide 38: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- In the labor market, firms demand for labor, and workers supply labor. What will happen if demand for labor increases? Will firms pay more in order to hire new workers?

## Slide 39: Phillips Curve

- Why?
- When the demand for labor increases, the pool of unemployed workers subsequently decreases and companies increase wages to compete and attract a smaller talent pool. The cost of wages increases and companies pass along those costs to consumers in the form of price increases. Thus, a lower unemployment rate ultimately translates to a higher inflation.

## Slide 40: Phillips Curve

## Slide 49: Expectation-Augmented Phillips Curve

- What economists initially failed to realize in constructing the Phillips curve was that people and firms take the expected level of inflation into account when deciding how much to produce and how much to consume. When workers expect prices to rise, they demand higher wages. When firms expect costs to rise, they set higher prices.
- where      is the inflation rate,         is the expected inflation rate,                  is the unemployment gap.

## Slide 78: The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. […] The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. 

Federal Open Market Committee, 11/5/20

- The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. […] The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

## Slide 79: What tools aside from changing the FFR does the Fed have to combat an economic downturn?

## Slide 80: Quantitative Easing (QE)

- “In addition, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.”

## Slide 81: What is QE?

- Goal: Increase the money supply and provide banks with liquidity, allowing them to increase lending, while decreasing risk (lower risk premia) and uncertainty in the market

## Slide 82: Forward Guidance

- “The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.“
- Federal Open Market Committee, 11/5/20
- Lower expected future short rates → lower current long rates (long rates are average of expected future short rates) → cheaper credit → higher spending

## Slide 83: Fiscal Policy

- Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
- Multiplier Effect: The total change in output is greater than the initial change because of further rounds of spending
- Automatic stabilizers = Social Welfare Net
- Unemployment insurance, social security payments

## Slide 84: Terms you might hear in the news

- Hawks vs Doves:
- Hawks favor high interest rates to keep inflation under control
- Doves worry that high rates can induce a recession. They want to keep rates low to encourage spending in the economy
- Paul Volcker: He was the Fed Chair from 1979-1987. He is a Hawk and famous for hiking interest rates in the 80s, and also being really tall. People draw comparisons between him and Jay Powell as of late
- Pivot: When the Fed shifts its monetary policy from contractionary to expansionary and vice versa
- Soft Landing: A gradual decline in production and activity that avoids triggering a recession. This is the Federal Reserve’s goal!
- Hard Landing: Think airplane. Occurs when there is a sudden harsh decline in growth and production. There is potential worry that we could be headed towards one if rate hikes go on for too long

## Slide 85: Topics we didn’t get to cover but wish we could’ve!

- Unconventional monetary policy
- Quantitative easing
- Forward guidance
- Fiscal Policy
- The 2008 Great Recession
- Volcker Disinflation in the 1980s
- Classical vs Keynesian thought

## Slide 86: Some great resources to stay in the loop

- Acemoglu and Johnson 2023
- To achieve the true potential of innovation, we need to ensure technology is creating new jobs and opportunities rather than marginalizing most people, through automated work and political passivity.  We need to use the tremendous digital advances of the last half century to create useful and empowering tools, and seize back control from a small elite of hubristic, messianic tech leaders pursuing
- their own interests.

## Slide 13: (untitled)

## Slide 14: Kyoto Protocol ~  Paris Agreement

- Measure - Take Stock
- Plan to Reduce

## Slide 15: Symmetric vs Asymmetric

- Both players have the same information, rules , strategy
- Both players have same outcome set
- Chess - symmetric
- Poker - players have different hands -
- part of play is revealing about other players hands
- Sports - different strengths, strategies
- home field advantage
- In a game theory payoff matrix
- Values are the same for each player
- Symmetry is often a simplifying assumption

## Slide 16: Simultaneous vs Non-Simultaneous

- Both players are making a simultaneous choice unknown to the other
- Prisoners Dilemma - each are in a separate room making a deal
- Rock-Paper-Scissors - making a simultaneous choice
- Non - Simultaneous
- First Mover advantage  ( move to block other players)
- Second Mover advantage  ( move to unseat incumbent)

## Slide 17: Perfect vs Imperfect Information

- Perfect Information
- Transparency - both sides know the rules
- No Uncertainty - outcomes are certain
- No Hidden information - both sides may know each others capacity
- Imperfect information
- Rules, setup of game not known
- Uncertainty - chance outcomes
- Hidden information - other players position

## Slide 18: Aside - Bots taking over Online Poker

- https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-poker-bots-artificial-intelligence-russia

## Slide 19: Strategies

- Systematic methods of playing games
  - tell players what move to make based on available information
  - essentially a probability distribution over a player’s choices
- Different types
  - pure strategies put all probability on a single choice
  - mixed strategies divide probabilities over an array of choices
- Strategies can be random but often aren’t
  - expected utility is a common counter-strategy for randomness
  - Nash equilibria (if they exist) tell us the “best” move to make in games of imperfect information
- Project - Program Strategies to play a series of games

## Slide 20: Aside: Payoff Matrices - phase 1 enrollment

- Alan is trying to schedule his classes and wants to enroll in two classes with conflicting final exam times. One class will not give accommodations and is required for his degree. Alan knows the other class will give an accommodation with probability 0.6. Consider the payoff matrix below.

## Slide 21: Expected Utility

- Enroll in both               0.6 \* 10 + 0.4 \* -10 = 2
- Don’t enroll in both     0.6\* 2 + 0.4 \*5 = 3.2

## Slide 22: Expected Utility Hypothesis

- The expected utility of a set of n outcomes xi is the average utility of each outcome u(xi) weighted by the probability of that outcome’s occurrence pi:
- The expected utility hypothesis says that when an individual makes a gamble, they will choose the option that maximizes their expected utility
  - the utility of each option is based on their preferences
- Expected utility maximization (under the EUH) is one way of strategizing in the face of randomness

## Slide 23: Prisoner’s Dilemma

- Prolific game first considered in the 1950s
- Single-round symmetric simultaneous non-cooperative game of perfect information
- Each prisoner can either cooperate (maintain their silence) or defect (talk to the police)
  - Does this sound familiar?
- Reading the payoff matrix: a higher value (more years in prison) is worse! our goal is to minimize the values in the payoff matrix

## Slide 24: Nash Equilibrium

- A set of strategy choices in a non-cooperative game in which no player can increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.

## Slide 25: Nash Equilibrium

- A set of strategy choices in a non-cooperative game in which no player can increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.
- What about the prisoner’s dilemma?

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

</details>

## Slide 26: Nash Equilibrium

- A set of strategy choices in a non-cooperative game in which no player can increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.
- What about the prisoner’s dilemma?
- Nash equilibria can be read from payoff matrices: to see if a game state is a Nash equilibrium, the first value in the cell must be the maximum among all first values in that column and the second value must be the maximum across all second values in that row.

## Slide 27: Oligopolies

- Markets in which the number of participants is limited, e.g. airlines
- Allow their participants to function collectively in a manner similar to a monopoly
  - when this collective monopoly is illegal, these are referred to as cartels

## Slide 28: Oligopolies

- Markets in which the number of participants is limited, e.g. airlines
- Allow their participants to function collectively in a manner similar to a monopoly
  - when this collective monopoly is illegal, these are referred to as cartels
- Within oligopolies, however, we can observe competition
  - participants try to take market share by lowering prices below the agreed-upon floor

## Slide 29: Oligopolies

- Within oligopolies, however, we can observe competition
  - participants try to take market share by lowering prices below the agreed-upon floor
  - e.g. 2020 oil price war that was started when Saudi Arabia lowered its prices below the OPEC price in response to Russia refusing to reduce production

## Slide 30: Opec Market Share over time

## Slide 31: US enters the stage as top producer and large exporter

## Slide 32: Cournot Competition

- Model of a market in which firms compete by changing their output
  - market has a fixed number of firms that produce the same product
  - firms do not collude but have market power
  - each firm knows the number of firms and has its own cost function used to determine its level of output
  - firms share a single, fixed marginal cost
- Monopoly
- downward sloping Demand curve
- Marginal revenue downward sloping
- Homogeneous project
- No product differentiation

## Slide 33: Cournot Competition

- OPEC is a good example of a Cournot oligopoly
  - its members affect market prices by changing their level of production
  - but this shows a flaw: Cournot equilibrium implies that collusion is the rational policy, but game theory shows us that cartel members undercut one-another
  - 40% of global production    60% of exports

## Slide 34: (untitled)

## Slide 35: What are we trying to do?

- We want to find the quantities that maximize firm 1 and 2’s profit
- Recall from the supply and demand units that firms maximize profits when they produce where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.
- However, the marginal revenue changes depending on the quantity produced.

## Slide 36: What do these Best Response Functions Tell Us?

- This graph depicts two cases; one where firm 2 produces so little that firm 1’s best response is to become a monopoly and overtake the market, the other is where firm 2 produces so much that firm 1’s best response is to produce 0.
- The best response functions are great because they give us a profit-maximizing output for every possible quantity the other firm can produce at.
- However, a best response function is not the Nash Equilibrium.

## Slide 37: Finding the Nash Equilibrium - Python Sympy

- Another way to look at Nash Equilibria is both players mutually best responding to each other.
- In the context of this game this is where both player’s best response functions intersect.

## Slide 38: Aside on finding the Nash Equilibrium Algebraically

- This math is not necessary for this class, but it may be useful to your own understanding.

## Slide 39: Cournot

- Each firm knows market demand but doesn’t know others quantity
- Each firm considers the reaction of others when it set own quantity
- Oligopoly - lower quantities and higher prices than perfect competition
- Nash Equilibrium - when each firm has no incentive to change output

## Slide 40: Aside - Meat packing

- I brought this up in Demand Lecture 2
- Four companies control 80% Beef and 65% Pork
- Whether there is a cartel is a huge lawsuit right now

## Slide 41: USDA

- Reduce purchases of beef cattle
- Coordinate Purchases
- Idle plants, reduce capacity
- https://www.choicesmagazine.org/choices-magazine/submitted-articles/is-there-price-fixing-in-the-us-beef-packing-industry

## Slide 42: Collusion - Oligopoly and Data - Information Sharing

- The availability of price and other market information for industry participants facilitates transparent price discovery and increases market efficiency, which generally has substantial procompetitive effects, with no harm to competition involved. However, in the case of imperfectly competitive industries, publicly available price and other market information may facilitate information exchanges among competitors, some of which may have anticompetitive effects (Bloom, 2014). The firms with market power can use price and other market information to facilitate their tacit or overt collusion and to effectively enforce it. Tacit collusion is a coordinated conduct of firms with market power that does not involve an explicit agreement among them in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Overt collusion is a coordinated conduct of firms with marketpower that involves an explicit agreement among them, which would violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
- There are opinions expressed in academic literature that may suggest that the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act might have created opportunities for tacit collusion in the beef packing industry (Wachenheim and DeVuyst, 2001; Cai, Stiegert, and Koontz 2011). In addition, some livestock producers expressed concerns that packers manipulated the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service Livestock Mandatory Reporting system (U.S. Department of Justice, 2012).
- Billions of dollars - explicit vs tacit collusion

## Slide 43: Bertrand Competition

- Similar to Cournot, but instead firms compete by changing price rather than output
  - assumes consumers want to pay the lowest price for goods
  - they will buy everything at the lower price
    - assumes that the firm offering the lower price has the capacity to meet the demand of the entire market at that price
    - if prices are equal, demand will be split evenly among them
  - predicts that even small competition (e.g. a duopoly) will result in prices being reduced to the marginal cost level

## Slide 44: Bertrand Competition

- Similar to Cournot, but instead firms compete by changing price rather than output
  - assumes consumers want to pay the lowest price for goods
  - they will buy everything at the lower price
    - assumes that the firm offering the lower price has the capacity to meet the demand of the entire market at that price
    - if prices are equal, demand will be split evenly among them
  - predicts that even small competition (e.g. a duopoly) will result in prices being reduced to the marginal cost level
- Coke vs. Pepsi is a good example of a Bertrand duopoly
  - both firms compete on price and take into account the price of their competitor
  - Defection benefits consumer

## Slide 45: Bertrand Competition

- Implications:
  - even a duopoly in a market is enough competition to push prices down to the level of perfect competition
  - but this model relies on serious assumptions
    - there are many reasons why consumers might not buy the lowest-priced item (e.g. non-price competition, search costs)
    - ignores the fact that firms may not be able to supply the entire market
  - including these factors results in a different conclusion

## Slide 46: Bertrand Competition

- Implications:
  - even a duopoly in a market is enough competition to push prices down to the level of perfect competition
  - but this model relies on serious assumptions
    - there are many reasons why consumers might not buy the lowest-priced item (e.g. non-price competition, search costs)
    - ignores the fact that firms may not be able to supply the entire market
  - including these factors results in a different conclusion
  - the model also demonstrates big incentives to cooperate and raise prices to the monopoly level
    - but this is not the Nash equilibrium of the model

## Slide 47: Firm 1 - setting price given P2

- Monopoly Price
- Cost of Production  - eg perf Comp price
- h= the cost to undercut
- (and get customers to switch)

## Slide 48: Bertrand - both firms reaction function

- Nash Equilibrium at Marginal Cost
- Because of perfect competition

## Slide 49: Bertrand Competition

## Slide 50: Bertrand Competition

## Slide 51: Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma

- Paradigm in which the prisoner’s dilemma is played repeatedly over multiple rounds
- Players know the history of their opponent but not their current move
- Was used to model the Cold War and MAD in the 1950’s
  - different strategies for playing this game were analyzed in order to see which was most effective at winning the game
- A famous tournament for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma was run by Robert Axelrod
  - the winning strategy at this tournament was tit-for-tat
  - excellent episode of Radiolab on this tournament
